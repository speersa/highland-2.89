CMT package for ROOT

This is a copy of the ROOT package that has been installed in the
repository so that it can be easily distributed within the ND280 group.  

To upgrade the version of ROOT.

1) Get a copy of head of the root CVS package. ("cmt checkout ROOT")

2) Get the tar file with the source for the new root from root.cern.ch and
   place it in the package root. (ROOT/<version>/<tar-file-goes-here>
   Delete previous version of tar file and patch file.
   
3) Edit the src/compile_root file to set the ROOT version and set the ROOT
   configuration flags.

4) Make sure the new version compiles.  If it doesn't compile, you may need
   to create a patch for the source.  This is detailed surgery, so if you
   need instructions you might just want to find a different version of
   ROOT that works.  The created diff should go into the package root with
   the extension ".patch".  Read the "compile_root" source to see the
   details. 

5) Once the version compiles and is "ready to go", add the new root file
   (and patch file) to the repository. Use the -ko option to the cvs add command
   to prevent it being corrupted by cvs, then commit.

6) Checkout the head into a new directory and check that it will build.  

7) Update the version number in the requirements file to match the
   intended tag.  Commit the modified requirements file.

8) Make sure you are in the <version> directory (this will be the
   old version)

9) Tag the new version using "cvs tag -F <version>"
