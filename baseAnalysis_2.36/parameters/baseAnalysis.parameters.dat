Whether to initialize trees or not at the beginning of ach configuration

 < baseAnalysis.InitializeTrees = 1 >	

--- RooTrackerVtxTree ------------

Enable/Disable reading the RooTrackerVtx tree in MiniTree and FlatTree converters (for oaAnalysis is always read)
 < baseAnalysis.ReadRooTrackerVtxTree = 1 >	

Enable/Disable saving the RooTrackerVtx tree in the MicroTree file
 < baseAnalysis.SaveRooTrackerVtxTree = 1 >	
 
 
Enable/Disable running on non-exclusive selections
 < baseAnalysis.AllowNonExclusiveSelections = 0 >

--- Converters -------
When enabled, then for flat-trees highland version of psyche RedoTreeConverter
will be used -> this is for direct tests of the converter
< baseAnalysis.Converter.FlatTree.RedoTreeConverter = 0 >

 --- Productions ------------

This parameter allows selecting production (FOR CORRECTIONS, BUNCHING AND SYSTEMATICS). 
 
 0 --> Select the production automatically based on the input file software version
 6 --> Production 6
 7 --> Production 7
 < baseAnalysis.Bunching.Production    = 0 >
 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.Production = 0 >
 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.Production = 0 >

 --- Cuts ------------

Enable/disable the beam quality cut when doing the "event_quality" cut.
This is useful when you are using oaAnalysis files that you processed yourself, and so
don't contain the beam data quality information. 
BY DEFAULT THIS SHOULD BE SET TO 1
 < baseAnalysis.EnableBeamQualityCut = 1 >
 
Enable/disable the ND280 data quality cut when doing the "event_quality" cut.
This is useful when you are using oaAnalysis files that you processed yourself, and so
don't contain the data data quality information. 
BY DEFAULT THIS SHOULD BE SET TO 1
 < baseAnalysis.EnableDataQualityCut = 1 >


 --- Corrections ------------

Disables all corrections regardless of the ones enabled below

 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.DisableAllCorrections  = 0 >

Apply all corrections even if they were already applied in the input file

 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.ForceApplyCorrections  = 0 >

Enable/Disable individual corrections

 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.EnableIgnoreRightECal   = 1 >
 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.EnableCT4POT            = 1 >
 < baseAnalysis.Corrections.EnableDQ                = 1 >

---- Flux weigthing ------------

This is used to fill the first component of the weight variable in the truth tree. 
Folder, Version and Tunning now in psycheND280Utils.parameters.dat

 < baseAnalysis.FluxWeighting.Enable = 1 >


The line below is needed for doxyneg documentation
//! [baseAnalysis.parameters.dat_systematics]
--- Event Weights ------------

Enable/disable configurations with a single systematic (when EnableSingleWeightSystConfigurations = 1)
and enable systematics in the "all_syst" configuration (when EnableAllSystematics = 1). 
Also enable the correction in the default tree. 

 < baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableSIPion            = 0 >	
 < baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableSIProton          = 0 >	

 < baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableFlux              = 1 >	 

This is to set whether to apply flux systematic: cov matrices are used
 < baseAnalysis.Weights.Flux.ApplySystematic    = 0 >

--- Systematics ------------

Number of toy experiments
 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.NumberOfToys = 0 >

The Random Seed. When throwing toys we want the same random numbers for all jobs. Thus, the random seed should be the same in all cases (and different from 0 !!!!)

     0 --> A pure random seed is generated based on time
 not 0 --> A fix random seed is used 

 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.RandomSeed = 1 >

Use a different random generator for each systematic

 < baseAnalysis.Systematics.IndividualRandomGenerator = 0 >


--- Configurations ------------

Create configurations with a single systematic ( a configuration for each systematic selected above)

 < baseAnalysis.Configurations.EnableSingleVariationSystConfigurations = 0 >
 < baseAnalysis.Configurations.EnableSingleWeightSystConfigurations    = 0 >

Enable/disable the configuration with all systematics (or the ones selected above)

 < baseAnalysis.Configurations.EnableAllSystematics = 0 >
 
 
Run numbering scheme: less than 
0 --> Select the production automatically based on the input file software version
0 - pre-Prod6T, 1 - prod6T, 2 -- prod7T

 < baseAnalysis.RunNumbering.Production.Scheme = -1 >
