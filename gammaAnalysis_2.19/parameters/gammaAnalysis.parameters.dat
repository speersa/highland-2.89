--- Cut levels: Use 11 if veto cuts are applied, 7 if they are not --------
 < gammaAnalysis.MinAccumLevelToSave = 7 >

 --- Analysis sample (1 for FGD1, 2 for FGD2, 3 for both) --------
 < gammaAnalysis.Analysis.FV.FGD = 1 >

--- Save the gamma initiator - slow  --------

--- Option to save in the truth tree all events that there is a gamma in the FGD (will make the output file size quite large). If off, then only events where a gamma daughter goes in the TPC will be saved in the truth tree --------
