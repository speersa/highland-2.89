\section nd280Highland2_v0r3_history Version v0r3

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Wed Oct  8 00:25:43 2014
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Anselmo-Cerveras-MacBook-Pro.local

This version is intended to work with psyche v1r5. 

New packages added:
  - numuCCMultiPiAnalysis
  - antiNumuCCAnalysis

- Correct few bugs 
- adopt latest changes in psyche data classes
- Make sure psyche and highland2 use the same FlatTree conversion
- Flat tree creation almost working: it creates working flat trees, but there is still a problem with truth info



\section nd280Highland2_v0r5_history Version v0r5

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Thu Oct  9 18:16:11 2014
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Anselmo-Cerveras-MacBook-Pro.local

Minor relase addresing some problems with FlatTrees created by highland2, and problems related with DrawingTools methods that need the selection definition 

- write(read) selections into(from) the config tree, such that they are known to the DrawingTools. 
  This is needed for functions as DrawEffVsCut, etc
- proper true track <--> true vertex association through vertex index (highland style). It was preventing truth info to be loaded correctly 
  for the FlatTrees created by Highland2
- for some reason TrueVertex Lepton and Proton branches were off and some variable in the microtree were not filled: 
  truemu_truemom, truemu_truedir, etc

This version uses the patched nd280Psyche version v1r5p1 


\section nd280Highland2_v0r7_history Version v0r7

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Sat Oct 11 00:57:32 2014
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Anselmo-Cerveras-MacBook-Pro.local

In this version numuCC, numuCCMultiPi and antiNumuCC selection have been validated with moderate statistics (10^6 events), 
With and without corrections, the exact same results as in highland are obtained.  
Although no surprises are expected another validation with more statistics should be done. 

Differences in with highland regaring systematics still need to be understood. 

This version of highland2 uses nd280Psyche v1r5p3
Main changes are:

- Fix some problems related to the FlatTree created from highland2 
- Add ability to use prod6 corrections. Prod can be chosen via parameters file in baseAnalysis. 
  This is needed for subsequent validation against highland
- in antiNumuCCAnalysis add the ability to choose the selection criteria (CCInc or CCQE/CCnQE) via parameter file



\section nd280Highland2_v0r9_history Version v0r9

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Mon Nov 17 18:13:30 2014
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: portanselmo.ific.uv.es


Fully validated	version of FlatTree creation, Selection and Systematics.
It will be used to create first	official FlatTrees. 

 - Import and externd versioning functionality from highland. There is a run time check of 
   input file version with nd280AnalysisTools. Also the proper correction files are used depending on the production
 - Sofware versions of all packages are saved into the config tree, for both FlatTree and microtrees
 - Corrections can be applied when creating the flat tree or when running on it. 
   Add functionality to avoid aplying twice the same correction 
 - Add all missing variables into the FlatTree 
 - Correct mistmatch between oaAnalysis and Flattree results mainly due to TPC tracks with several segments in the same TPC. 
   Now the agreement is perfect. 
 - Save all true tracks in the FlatTree to avoid differences in some of the systematics. To be optimised



\section nd280Highland2_v0r11_history Version v0r11

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Sun Nov 30 15:17:15 2014
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Release for the highland to highland2 migration tutorial on Dec 1st 2014.
Selections give the same results for oaAnalysis and FlatTrees
Systematics give slighly different results (Under investigation). Not crucial for tutorial


- update to changes in psyche related to variable size arrays
- make the definition of an analysis more user fiendly. Corrections, Systematics and Configurations are now defined in different methods.
- Correct bug in association between micro-trees and RooTrackerVtx  tree 
- new highlandUtils package, in which utilities from several highland packages have been put. 
- Use members in VersioninUtils to control independenty the production for 
  corrections, systematics and bunching

antiNumuCCAnalysis

- Added flux tuning (for antineutrinos) parameters. Also added parameter to turn on/off FGD1/FGD2 selection. 
- CC inclusive selection for antineutrinos in FGD2. NOT VALIDATED.

numuCCQEAnalysis

- First version of FGD-ECal->SMRD matching systematics (combined with SMRD reco efficiency), 
 for the moment only those tracks are considered that have FGD-ECal component, 
 for this case it is easier to estimate the systematics



\section nd280Highland2_v0r13_history Version v0r13

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Wed Dec 10 19:37:35 2014
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local


This is n principle the final freeze to be used for the winter oscillation analysis together with nd280Psyche v1r13

This version has corrected several bugs:
 * DrawEffVSCuts in DrawingTools
 * RooTrackerVtx link (#1059)
 * Few bugs in numuCCQEAnalysis
 * Toy experiment random seed

- Has added more version check functionality to avoid mismatching between input trees and compilation
- ECAL PID variables, needed by some analyses, has been added
- Has FGD-ECAL-SMRD and mom range systematics for numuCCQEAnalysis
- Has corrected few memory leaks in oaAnalysisTreeConverter
 


\section nd280Highland2_v0r15_history Version v0r15

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Thu Jan  8 05:19:40 2015
   - Freeze User: izmaylov
   - Freeze Host: localhost.localdomain

A new freeze of nd280Highland2;
the main goal is to have a stable version to provide the flat-trees for winter 2014-2015 oscillation analysis

also includes the first version of "extended" converters/data_classes to provide  ECal local variables


Other changes:
frozen versions of numuCCQEAnalysis/numuCCQExsecAnalysis and highlandRecPack (the latter is disabled by default) for TN-214/216 xsec analysis

antiNumuCCPiZeroAnalysis package (commented out by default)



\section nd280Highland2_v0r17_history Version v0r17

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Thu Jan  8 19:19:16 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Main purpose of this release is to allow official FlatTree creation for winter analyses
Correct few bugs in psyche and highland2: 

psycheCore:
- SystBox: proper initialization of all variables in the constructor (all pointers to NULL)
  and proper destructor (correctly delete all array pointers,  so no more compiler dependent since [] was missing),
  delete pointers to arrays of invPT and invPT_true,  the latter should fix some memory leak

psycheUtils:
- update table of the fgd mass to account for the latest knowledge of the measured mass of the scintillators 

highlandTools:
- Temporary workaround in AnalysysAlgorithm for bug #1059. It will now result in many nRooTrackerVtxes being saved twice, 
  but otherwise very few entries are missing for the truth tree (which is a total show stopper for use with the xsTool and thus not acceptable).

highlandIO:
- ECal LLR variables of TTrackerECALReconModule are only available for prod6
  so added a conditional compilation  to account for it



\section nd280Highland2_v0r19_history Version v0r19

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Tue Jan 27 22:36:39 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

the main goal is to refelct the recent changes in psyche` SystBoxB
so have a version for the nd280Highland2 freeze


This is probably the last release before the CM. It has lots improvements in documentation, including a new 
tutorialAnalysis package.

- use psyche v1r21
- add a tutorialAnalysis package, which explains with working code most of the funtionality
- add lots of doxigen documentation which should generate the web site
- solve bugs 1059, 1065, 1066, 1070 and  1071, 
- in numuCCAnalysis add ability to run fgd1 or fgd2 selections (chosen via paameters file)
- add ECAL variables
- Add support for several selections in both the standard micro-trees and the truth tree. 
- Create a different box for each enabled selection. 
- Change the way RooTrackerVtx tree is filled. This should probebly solve bug 1059, but we should check
- adapt to the recent changes in psyche regaring the SystBoxB



\section nd280Highland2_v0r21_history Version v0r21

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Wed Feb 18 12:38:57 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

- Use nd280Psyche v1r23
- Two new packages added: numuBkgInAntiNuModeAnalysis and nueCCAnalysis
- Correct many bugs related with the DrawingTools
- Solve bug related with RooTrackerVtx link
- Add default mainpage.dox to all packages shuch that they can be referenced from another one in doxygen using \ref
- Add local recon infraestructure to DataClasses and input converters (disabled by default)
- Correct bug in the treatment of IgnoreRightECalRuns3and4Correction
- Por stuff from highland, mainly related to GlobalVertex and some little bugs corrected there
- Take into account the ecal alignment


\section nd280Highland2_v1r1_history Version v1r1

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Tue Mar 31 19:51:40 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Major freeze with many changes, mostly in psyche 
to allow selection depending systematics, and performance optimization. 

This includes: 
- New methods in Selections to tune the systematics
- A new definition of boxes to make the code faster and allow selection dependent systematics
   ToyBoxB: Previously called AnaBox, with more variables. It is toy dependent
   EventBoxB: allows saving objects that are valid for all toys in the same event
   SystBoxB: To save the relevant tracks and true tracks for each systematic, depending on the selection
- Preselection cuts t make the code faster
- Option to not redo the selection, when variations do not change the relevant cuts behaviour.
- A better way of treating selections in different detectors (FGD1, FGD2, etc)
- Add all relevant selections for FGD2

All selections and systematics give the exact same results for FGD1 and FGD2 as in the patched version (v0r21p1 and v1r23p1) except:
- MomentumResoluton and BField which are slightly different due to a bug now corrected
- antiNumu gives different systematic results for FGD2. To be understood, but notice that this selection was not in psyche previously 

Some packages have been removed from the master package since they are not yet adapted



\section nd280Highland2_v1r3_history Version v1r3

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Thu Apr 30 18:20:31 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local


Many bugs have been corrected in this version. Specially:
 - bug 1120: we now get a perfect agreement between oaAnalysis and FlatTrees both for selectios and systematics, which was not the case before for systematics, 
   although the difference was small. The problem was mostly when processing oaAnalysis files directly 
 - bug 1091: The bug related with POT counting. It is worth noting that the POT counting is now slighly higher for MC. 

Other changes:
 - the EventBox functionality have been improved
 - put back the nueCCAnalysis package
 - new numuCCMultiTargetAnalysis added

psyche:
Correct many bugs, specially related with FlatTree-oaAnalysis and improve EventBox functionality
- temporary solution to make SIPion work with event preloading. Make Initialize and FinalizeEvent methods virtual
- correct important memory leak introduced in previous release. Must delete the arrays created within the steps
- proper treatment of indices for variation systematics. Worked for the default systematics but not for the ones added by the user
- the task of creating the EventBox is given to each Selection. This does not mean that there will be an EventBox per selection, 
 but there could be several boxes. They are created and filled in the InitializeEvent method of the selection
 Add another level of abstraction in the EventBox. The base class EventBox contains only TracksInGroup and TrueTracksInGroup. 
 The user should inherit from it. The AnaEventB has now an array of EventBoxes, which are added by index
- FGD2 selection modified to be exclusive with respect to the anti-nu selection in FGD1
- move numuCC backward selection to psyche
- Properly deal with the EventBox, which must be created now in the InitializeEvnet method of the selections
- Set the preselection accum level to 2 for all selections. That means that only one toy will be run when the 
  quality_fiducial cut is not passed
- now that systematics and selections are validated we can start using IsRelevantSystematic to avoid 
  switching them off manualy in the parameters file
- OOFVFGD2_p5F.dat  was missing
- MomResol, BField, TPCClusterEff, TPCTrackEff, TPCFGDMatch and ChargeID where giving different results in oaAnalysis and FlatTrees because 
 they were using explicitely TPCSegments and FGDSegments with a particular index, assuming ordering is the same in FlatTrees and oaAnalysis. 
 Also we have to deal with the problem of several segments in the same detector. This solves bug 1120


highlandTools:
- Many bugs solved (944, 1043, 1103, 1107, 1014, 1112, 1113, 1114, 1117). 

baseAnalysis:
- Schedule for adding RooTrackerVtx and fill RooVtxEntry, RooVtxIndex, and TruthVertexID (now toy vars) in FillToyVarsInMicroTrees. 
 In this way if any of the toys in any of the configurations 
 has the proper accum level the RooVtxTracker entry will be saved. This solves bug 998 
 Don't fill the RooTrackerVtx tree here, but schedule the vertex to be saved. In that way filling is more transparent and is done in a single place

highlandCorrections:
- added a fix to account (for a problem related) to bug 1102,  do not use covUtils method
 to set the sub-detector used bit (since the latter uses some hard-coded values to account for oaAnalysis numbering)

highlandIO:
Many bugs corrected. It is worth noting that the POT counting is now slighly higher for MC (bug 1091): 

- partially fix bug 1097
- in truth tree save also 2p2h for nuwro (that has reaction code 70)
- To get the POT from the RooTrackerVtx tree loop over estries until the POT for a given vertex is not 0. 
  Previously only the last entry was checked. This should solve bug 1091
- fix bug 1101 (suppress warnings from GetParticle for flattrees without RooTrackerVtx)
- wrong offset for sPOTSincePreviousSpill produces a runtime error becaouse of index beaing added twice
- Fixed double counting GENIE POTs
- fix bug 1107
- avoid crash before warnings when running over a prod5 file with highland compiled with prod6
- add protection against empty spills to solve bug 1104. Skip the spill when the RooTrackerVtx 
 has no vertices. This condition is not applied for cosmics
- add antinu NC in truth tree explicitly



\section nd280Highland2_v1r5_history Version v1r5

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Tue Jun 23 10:12:04 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Many changes in psyche and highland2, most of them related with new functionality:
- MiniTree: Create and read MiniTrees. Validated against oaAnalysis
- Systematics tunning. switched off by default
- Automatic geometry: loaded from the input file(s)
- PerSpill POT for MC and also for MiniTree
- etc. 


In addition:
 - correct several "minor" bugs in oaAnalysisTreeConverter
 - Add new systematics: ProtonSI and Momentum by range resolution
 - Improve PileUp and TpcDeDx corrections and systematics
 - Use new method for propagation of eff-like systematics


This version has been partially validated:
 - numuCCMultiPi selection gives same results as summer analysis patched version, and same results 
   with oaAnalysis, FlatTrees and MiniTrees
 - systematics for numuCCMultiPi give same results as patched version except ChargeID (very small difference under investigation) 
   and TpcTrackEff (expected) 

Hope to start using highlandValidation for next freeze


\section nd280Highland2_v1r7_history Version v1r7

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Wed Jul  1 16:42:48 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Release motivated mainly by baseAnalysis splitting:

- split baseAnalysis package such that it only keeps what is common to all analyses (p0d and tracker). 
  Many things from baseAnalysis moved to new package baseTrackerAnalysis. Add new baseP0dAnalysis

But also quite a few improvements in psyche:

- Solve several problems related to the MiniTree (bug 1124) including memory leaks and linking between objects
- Make it work with event preloading
- Update OOFVSystematics and  TPCTrackEffSystematics to new methods used in the patched version. Results are now identical
- Flux tuning: correctly handle Run 6 flux tunings. update to new files from http://www.t2k.org/beam/NuFlux/FluxRelease/13arelease/tunedflux13av1.1_june
- Some small changes in the TPC detector definition, which should affect slighly the OOFV systematic

Partial validation done: numuCCMultiPiAnalysis gives identical results for selection and systematics as in the official patch version, 
except a small difference in OOFV systematic due to the change in the tpc volume definition. 
We hope yo move to continues validation using Jenkins before the next release 


\section nd280Highland2_v1r9_history Version v1r9

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Sat Aug  1 14:52:02 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

This release has been fully validated with jenkings. This is why the highlandValidation package is included now. 

- Performance improvements with the new CheckRedoSelection method, enabled now by default for the first time.
  It gives the same results but selections run much faster. 
- remove toy variation and weights from the micro-trees, since they imply saving the same numbers for each event (2 x NTOYS x NSYSTPARMS > 60000 floats for eaxh event), increasing by almost a factor 
 of 10 the micro-tree size. Those numbers are now saved in the config tree as part of each configuration
 ( CONF._toys.variations and CONF._toys.weights, see ConfigurationBase.hxx). This will have implications in the validation, which will fail for the removed variables, and on the xsTool
 This change improves the performance considerably 
- Update systematic propagation to official patched version
- Several bugs solved, including small memory leaks
- DOn't allow non-exclusive selections by default

Change variable names as suggested in bug 1144

    truemu_truemom      --> truemu_mom
    truemu_truecostheta --> truemu_costheta
    truemu_truepos      --> truemu_pos
    truemu_truedir      --> truemu_dir
    vertex_det          --> selvtx_det
    vertex_pos          --> selvtx_pos
    vertex_truepos      --> selvtx_pos
    nu_vertex_truepos   --> truevtx_pos

   - Freeze Date: Thu Sep 24 15:49:27 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0-2.local


SUMMARY: 
- This version solves many bugs: 1087, 1143, 1149, 1167, 1169, 1172, 1174, 1175, 1179, 1181, 1183
- Several memory leaks corrected, specially the ones related with reading the MicroTree and using the localReconBunch
- Several systematics and corrections added
- Selections are now more robust since the selection construction is validated
- fully validated with jenkins: 24 expected failures because of bugs corrected

nd280Psyche: 
- Many bugs corrected 1175, 1179, 1169, 1181, 1087  (1087 and 1175 waiting for confirmation)
- Selection validation introduced
- solve bug 1167 releated with finding the right entry in the RooTrackerVtx tree
- adapt to new selection validation: two steps cannot have same title in the same branch
- added ToF resolution systematics,  
- split EventBoxB::GroupEnum into TrackGroupEnum and TrueTrackGroupEnum
- Update run number -> run enumeration code to handle the full Run 6 MC file set

highlandTools:
- Solve bugs: 1169, 1175, 1179
- Fix memory leaks when using AnaLocalReconBunch
- Fix problem with POT when adding many files due to numerical precission. Change to doubles 

highlandUtils:
- ToFSenseCorrector.cxx:  a new class that can deal with different ToF business,  check whether a track needs bwd flipping,  flip it
 etc. guess eventually it should be migrated to psyche(Utils),  keep it here for the moment till is approved by highland/psyche gods
- parameters file for highlandUtils,  for the moment some ToF stuff
- CheckRooTrackerVtxLink.cxx: don't count as failures events that have no true vertex associated because the vertex is not yet associatet either 
 (the accum level is to low). In those cases TruthVertexID=-999. 
 Reduce the fraction of allowed failures to 1 per mil

highlandCorrections:
- added ToF correction (smears MC to match data) and also there is an option to actually flip/reverse tracks if needed
based on ToF info. the correction may be useful for various analysis so should be kept in a general package (similar one exists in numuCCBwdAnalysis)


highlandIO:
- Correct Bug 1167: Highland2 analyses can get stuck in an infinite loop if using the skip events (-s) command line option.
- Correct Bug 1172:  oaAnalysisTreeConverter::DeleteBadObjects crash
- Correct Bug 1174: issues in deleting fully contained events
- Correct Bug 1143: RunCreateFlatTree crashes with prod 5 control sample files
- Solve bug with rooTrackerVtx links in mini tree
- Fix memory leaks related to local recon objects

baseTrackerAnalysis: new systematics:
 ToFResolSystematics
 TPCECalMatchEffSystematics
 TPCP0DMatchEffSystematics
 FGDECalMatchEffSystematics
 FGDECalSMRDMatchEffSystematics
 ECalTrackEffSystematics

baseAnalysis:
- use the new HighlandMiniTreeConverter such that the correct AnaSpillB type is created

all analysis packages: 
- attept to solve bugs 1183, 1149 and 1169 by moving most code in the analyses constructors to their Initialize methods. 
  At the moment only the package version and the UseAnalysis functionality is kept in the constructors



\section nd280Highland2_v1r13_history Version v1r13

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Sun Jan 10 14:37:00 2016
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0-2.local

SUMMARY: 
- Solve many bugs: 1193, 1210, 1214, 1216, 1221, 1222, 1229, 1234, 1237, 1238
- Many improvements in ECAL and P0D related systematics
- Modifications in numuCCMultiPiSelection
- Many DrawingTools improvements
- add example of P0D analysis using native highland2 objects fully integrated into the system. 
- DOCUMENTATION IS NOT FULLY UPDATED. PENDING FOR NEXT RELEASE

nd280Psyche: 
- Many improvements in ECAL and P0D related systematics
- ToFSenseCorrector: moved here from hihglandUtils. Many improvements
- Variables for 4pi analysis added
- Modifications in numuCCMultiPiSelection
- New way of initializing selections. Still to be improved !!!!
- Functionality to load all parameters files following the package hierarchy, 
  such that the top level package is read first and its parameters are fixed

highlandTools:
- Many DrawingTools improvements
- Solve many bugs: 1193, 1210, 1214, 1216, 1221, 1222, 1229, 1234, 1237
- New approach for categories

highlandUtils:

- Added functions that compute PID likelihoods including the kaon hypothesis.
 This is necessary because the kaon dE/dx variables are not in psyche.
- add FillCategories method taking a AnaTrueVertexB as argument instead of AnaTrackB. In that way selections with no MainTrack defined (i.e. NC in P0D) can still fill the categories
- add "nuparent" and get rid of obsolete GetAntiNuParent
- add CATSAND code to all categories when is sand MC (addressing bug 1237)
- remove GetReactionSand* methods
- reflect the fact that the AnaTrueVertexB::Detector member is now properly filled with psyche bits:
 for drawing/colors use oaAnalysis definitions
- Use the GetCategories method with a true vertex and event as input from FillTruthTreeCategories, which was essentially the same. 
 Mark the last as deprecated. 
- add some utilities for P0D. They will be probably moved somewhere else once this is stable
- ToFSenseCorrector moved into psycheUtils

highlandCorrections:

- dEdx corrections for data for run6 (April to June2015) are now available. Corrections for run 6 are all the same for all subset of runs (semi-rdp, pc1_Jan-to-April and pc1_April-to-June) 
- Improvements in ToFCorrection
- new FlipKinematicsCorrection to recover reverse fit failures, needs highlandRecPack
- new MomRangeCorrection: use highlandRecPack to substitute prange values (since is easier to estimate the systematics this way)
  only RangeMomentumMuon is affected

highlandIO:
- Add functionality for complete treatment of P0D contained objects 
- Don't read branches not present in the tree, to solve bug 1238. 
- add SpillsSincePreviousSavedSpill functionality for the MiniTree

highlandValidation:

- Updated nominals to latest frozen versions in nd280Highland2 v1r11
- Basic tests for minitree version validation
- basic tests using drawingtools
- added additional tests specific to p0d analyses (e.g. nmichel, np0d)
- added parameters directory and included systematics.paramters and p0danalyses.parameters
- remove sand type checks, since they don't exist now

baseTrackerAnalysis: 

- reflect changes in syst package (removed copying of SystematicSource)
- added ECal PID syst
- some minor re-organization of the order
- to define configurations use parameters from the base class, instead of 
 reading them from param file (they are being read from the baseClass anyway)
- use zero-var configuration

baseAnalysis:

- If a true vertex does not exist (e.g. can happen that reco vertex is not yet available
 at this step of the selection) then store the accum_level to all true vertices
 of the bunch -> i.e. this basically corresponds to the fact that event as a whole passed some cuts)
- added a zero_variation configuration, grabs the enabled systematics from all_syst 
 but runs only one toy with zero variation, in this way one gets a separate tree that 
 can be used to study/use the corrections applied by the systematics (wieght ones through 
 weight_syst/weight_syst_total weights)
- since baseAnalysis provides/controls configurations for downstream packages,  use the corresponding
 parameters so not to read param file in each downstream analysis
- correct bug affecting cases in which not all selections are enabled. The size of the AnaTrueVertex::AccumLevel vector must match the number of enabled 
 selections and not the total number of selections
- FillTruthTreeCategories(vtx, det, IsAntinu);  ---> anaUtils::FillCategories(&vtx, det, IsAntinu, input().GetSpill().GetIsSandMC());
 such that sand muons are taken into account also in truth tree. This should solve bug 1237

baseP0dAnalysis:
- add example of P0D analysis using native highland2 objects fully integrated into the system. Examples on how to get the information are given 
 This example will be use to further improve the data model and utilities for p0d analysis. It can be used by people to learn how to 
 do p0d analyses. 
- add macro p0dExamplePlots.C with some plot examples about the selection

  for the moment proton and kaon SI will inherit from it. 

highlandTools:
- P0DDataClasses: Remove Type and Position from AnaP0DHit and add GeomID and Time. Add an EventBox for P0D, EventBoxP0D2 because 
  p0dNumuCCAnalysis already defines EventBoxP0D. To be changed there

 start/stop in a given det and fail TPC quality

highlandUtils: 
- TransverseUtils: Add utils for calculating transverse kinematics.
- CategoriesUtils: add optional argument useCATSAND in FillCategories to allow sand muons dedicated studies
  (setting it to false sand muons will be categorized)

highlandIO:
- oaAnalysisTreeConverter: Remove Type and Position from AnaP0DHit and add GeomID and Time. 
- CreateFlatTree: added MomRangeCorrection

baseTrackerAnalysis:
- fixed a typo when adding the ECalEMSyst into the single syst configuration
- FlipKinematics, ToF and MomRange correcitons,  OFF by default, need highlandRecPack
 to fully work

p0dNumuCCAnalysis:
- setting default p0d-fv in psycheUtils. Remove override here. 
- Highland2 class now uses geometry to determine material.
- Also decoupled water throws from non-water as advised by Clark
- Changed data files to split things into different materials

p0dNumuCCQEAnalysis:
- Initial version of data files for OOFV systematic
- Added new OOFV class. Varies non-P0D detectors using rate values from FGD OOFV class. Includes possible reco systematics for: P0D USECal, P0D CECal, P0D WT.

baseP0dAnalysis: 
- don't increase version number to v2 because this package will dissapear. 
  It will be renamed as baseP0DAnalysis, as suggested by P0D people
- Fill P0DHit Position and Type from the GeomID
- use the new EventBox for P0D

\section nd280Highland2_v2r3_history Version v2r3

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Thu May  5 22:20:38 2016
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0-2.local

- There were two freezes of psyche (v3r3 and v3r5) for a single highland freeze (this)
- This freeze includes mainly the new conception of weights, which includes correction and systematics in the same object 
- Many bugs corrected: 1144, 1224, 1237, 1247, 1257, 1262#c3, 1278, 1282, 1283, 1296, 1304, 1306, 1307, and others not in Bugzilla

CHANGES IN PSYCHE (v3r5)
---------------------

MAINLY CORRECT BUGS IN MACHINERY. ALSO NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN SYSTEMATICS AND SELECTIONS (BUT NOT IN MACHINERY)

Correct bugs 1306, 1307,  1257, 1247, 1282, 1224, 1278, 1262#c3

psycheCore: correct potential bug in WeightType constructor: give the correction as first argument and the systematic as second argument
psycheEventModel: use dynamic_cast instead of static_cast in conversions from AnaParticleB to AnaTrackB since P0D objects are not AnaTracks. 
   This affects only MiniTree reading (and is only one per spill, so no problem with speed)
psycheSelections: protonSI improvements in numuCC and antiNumuCC
psycheSteering: remove obsolete CCQE stuff, which was removed from psycheSelections
psycheSystematics:
- TPCP0DMatchEffSystematics FGD-ECal/SMRD matching : use fine-tuning (IsRelevant...)
- TPCClusterEffSystematics, TPCFGDMatchEffSystematics: correct bug, correction should be given as first argument to Weight_h
- FluxWeightSystematics: Use ToyBoxND280, which is common for P0D and Tracker

CHANGES IN HIGHLAND PACKAGES:
--------------------------------

- BinnedData --> BinnesParams to avoid confusion (Data vs MC)
- SystematicWeightBase    --> EventWeightBase, SystematicVariationBase --> EventVariationBase
- The return type of the EventWeightBase::Apply is now Weight_h which is used as typedef in WeightType
- Changes in method names: TrackCategory --> Category, TrackType --> CategoryType

highlandCore:
- We are in the process of converting all weight systematics into a weight correction + systematic. In that way the default configuration can have all corrections associated with 
 weight systematics. Add weight_corr and weight_corr total variables to the micro-trees (including default). weight_corr contains all weight corrections included 
 the pileup and flux that were previously in the weight variable (kept for the moment, but not used anywere)
- use the new EventWeight and EventVariation Managers
- For the moment add a ZeroToyMaker (with zero variation), which is used for the default configuration  
- port from highland2 v1r15 the fix for bug 1237

highlandEventModel:
- for AnaECALParticle moved Length var into BaseDataClasses,  hence no need to depend on AnaSubTrack, 
- temporary use dynamic_cast to discriminate between AnaTrack and AnaParticle
- SMRD EDeposit added, added Length variable for AnaTrack, needed for some tests
- add new classes to P0DDataClasses_LinkDef.h, needed for MiniTree creation

highlandIO: 
- treat new variables in highlandEventModel
- use dynamic_cast to discriminate between AnaTrack and Other AnaParticleB types. 
 We have to see if this is the best solution. Temporarily Don't call DeleteBadObjects when using p0D native objects (_isUsingReconDirP0DNew=true) since it is giving problems. 
- oaAnalysisP0DTreeConverter: Proper treetmeant of objects created by global and local recon in FillP0DVertexInfo
- FlatTreeConverter: Enable P0D nodes branch, Properly treat inheritance from RedoTreeConverter 
- DataClassesIO: fixed a bug in filling the Length variable for the sub-detectors
- added the missing correction into the mini-tree creator
- enable TPC PID pull MC correction

highlandUtils:
- CategToolsNueCC: Add nue categories utils.
- P0DAnalysisUtils: Use dynamic_cast to distinguish between p0d objects inheriting from AnaTrack and from AnaParticleB. 
- TranseversUtils removed and moved to psycheUtils

highlandTools:
- SystematicTools: COMPUTE SYSTEMATICS WITH RESPECT TO THE AVERAGE OF ALL TOYS
- DrawingToolsBase: correct bugs 1304, 1283, 1237, 1296, and some others not in bugzilla
- New WeightTools namespace, where weights are applied
- DrawUtils: add new option for weight corrections WCi NWCi and WCORR. New method to add a legend entry with a defined height

highlandCorrections: 
- Inprovements in ToFCorrection, FlipKinematicsCorrection and TPCPIDPullMCCorrection.
- add correction enums, CorrId.hxx

baseAnalysis:
- add parameters to control weight corrections. Only FluxWeight is enabled
- weight corrections added to all configurations. zero var weight systematics to the default configuration. Only Flux enabled

baseTrackerAnalysis:
- Add the nue specific systematics.
- enable TPC PID pull MC correction
- weight corrections added to all configurations (only pileup enabled)

numuCCAnalysis:
- SMRD vars (similar to ECal),  needed for possible tests
- add reconstructed energy variable (which only use muon kinematics) from QE formula: selmu_nuErecQE, truemu_nuErecQE,
- correct bug 1144

baseP0DAnalysis: 
- ToyBoxP0D inherits now from ToyBoxND280, which contains the TrueVertex

p0dNumuCCAnalysis:
- p0dDataClasses->p0dAnaDataClasses so not to coincide with highlandEventModel/P0DDataClasses on certain systems

nueCCAnalysis:
 - FULLY INTEGRATE INTO PSYCHE: systematics, selections and utilities moved to psyche. Pileup rorrections removed (they are now weights)

numuCCMultiTargetAnalysis:
- Changes in Erec variables 

highlandTutorial:
- Add example of using reconstructed neutrino direction. This should solve bug 1247
- update comments to new version

   - Freeze Date: Mon Jun 13 00:16:12 2016
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0-2.local


- new 4pi selection introduced
- Many bugs corrected: 1006, 1247, 1260, 1263, 1278, 1296, 1301, 1312, 1317, 1319, 1321, 1322, 1323, 1324, 1328

CHANGES IN PSYCHE (v3r7)
---------------------

Many bugs corrected. Main changes are: 
- bug in SubRun reading from FlatTrees
- bug in GetIsMC() that resulting in isMC=true for data
- First version of the 4pi selection in psyche
- many improvenments in nue, antiNue and gamma selections
- renaming of numuBkg selections
- BunchPosition.dat:  New temporary Bunch timing to include the first Run 7 data. 


CHANGES IN HIGHLAND PACKAGES:
--------------------------------


highlandCore:
- rootmap_setup: Only the packages highlandCore depends on should be specified
- CategoryClasses: add methods to get colors, names and codes for a given catagory to solve bug 1006
- AnalysisAlgorithm, AnalysisLoop 
 - Add FillConfigTree() method to AnalysisAlgorithm and call it from AnalysisLoop such that one can add user's defined 
   config tree variables. Move common config tree variables from AnalysisLoop to AnalysisAlgorithm
 - Add analysis point functionality. AnalysisLoop sets into AnalysisAlgorithm the point at which it is. 
   This allows for example avoiding to use the ToyBox from FillTruthTree (see bug 1321)


highlandEventModel:
- DirectionStartFlip var moved here from the base class
- Add bools IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhoton and
  IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhotonChild to AnaTrueParticle class, since
  determining these properties after the fact is laborious.
- rootmap_setup.csh: add rootmap file for .csh. 


highlandIO: 
 - many changes in FlatTreeConverter
 - New variables saved to FlatTree: spill trigger; IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhoton and IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhotonChild in AnaTrueParticle; 
   IsPauliBlocked, IsCohOnH, NPrimaryParticles from the TrueVertex into the FlatTree
 - highlandIO.parameters.dat: enable momentum resolution MC correction
 - add MiniTreeConverter to FlatTree creation such that we create a FlatTree from a MiniTree

highlandUtils:
- P0DAnalysisUtils: Added class to fill P0D michel clusters from AnaP0DVertex
- CategToolsNueCC: Minor. Make sure that signal electron is not coming from a pi0.
- HighlandTreeConverterUtils: move FillTrueVertexRooInfo from the tree converters to HighlandTreeConverterUtils, since the method was common for FlatTree and oaAnalysis


highlandTools:
- rootmap_setup: remove dependency on highlandEventModel. Fix .csh script
- DrawingToolsBase: 
 - correct bug in arrow directions for cut lines (bug 1322)
 - specify default options for AddCategory in method ChangeCategory. related to bug 1006
   as explained in bug 1296:
   0 correspond to no style change, 1 to old T2K style and 2-4 to new T2K style. Default is 1
   In this way we keep the old behavior for DraingTools("",false)
 - give access to config tree tools. 
 - truemu --> truelepton
 - GetSameLevel was called when it shouln't producing bugs as bug 1329
 - add methods to set auto colors and auto markers to solve bug 1329
- ConfigTreeTools: Add set of tools to deal with the config tree. For the moment just a method to retrieve the Weight order for a given weight name



highlandCorrections: in MomResolMCCorrection
- adopting to changes in psycheND280Utils
- use methods with ToyExperiment input (so to be general between systematics and correction)
- use a paramter (read from psycheSystematics) to contol whether to use new smearing based on TPC-local info propagated
 to global

baseAnalysis:

baseTrackerAnalysis:
- got rid of -Alt systematics (they only add additional ProtonMomentum smearing, 
 will be re-implemented (and properly,  no a simple full code copy) if needed)
- enable MomentumResol MC correction (smearing to match data)

numuCCAnalysis:


- fill new var true_signal
- fix selmu_nuErecQE (need to use GetToyVarValue instead of GetVarValue)
- var renaming (bug 1144)
   truemu_fgd     -> truemu_det
   selmu_fgd      -> selmu_det
 remove     (truelepton_fgd -> truelepton_det) since it is similar to detector
 (follow better conventions and actually the value filled is any detector enum)
- move truelepton TruthTree variables from numuCCAnalysis to baseAnalysis after changing name from truemu to truelepton (bug 1144)
- add truelepton_pdg since it was removed from baseAnalysis. This is not the same as particle in the micro-trees since 
 particle corresponds to the pdg code of the true particle associated to the candidate muon (it would be selmu_pdg), while 
 truelepton_pdg is the pdg code of the true lepton from the true vertex associated to the candidate
- add FillConfigTree method with nNucleons variables (see https://bugzilla.nd280.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188#c45)
- add truevtx_mass_component (see https://bugzilla.nd280.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188#c45)
- ContituenetsUtils methods related ith the mass component and the Fgd module type take now "bool IsMC" as argument, and not event, since event is not avaiable 
 in FillTruthTree


nueCCAnalysis: All the datacard parameters are now moved to psyche.

numuCCMultiPiAnalysis
- fill true_signal
- minor: in FillToyVarsForMicroTree() added a protection that the MainTrack exists
- Get MichelElectrons from EventBox and not from ToyBox, since they are toy independent

highlandValidation
  tests.py 
  - now truemu variables are called truelepton both for truth tree and micro-trees
  - remove truelepton_pdg from truth tree validation and add particle both for truth and default trees
  - add one more plot for systematic weights to cover all enabled ones. Put the right ranges

 systematics.parameters.dat: disable antinu flux and sandmu systematics. Keep flux nu enabled for new version but disabled for all version

SUMMER RELEASE !!!!


SUMMARY:

Many bugs solved: 

1303 Syst tuning - some possible inconsistency in which tracks TPC-track-eff, TPC-cluster-eff and FGD-TPC-tracl-eff are applied to
1304 DrawingTools cut lines with log scales
1311 with latest highland2 v2r3, non-weight systematics trees don't have NWEIGHTSYST and weight_syst_total
1318 having different true var names in truth and reco trees (truemu_mom renamed)
1329 The default colour cycle is hard to distinguish (DrawingTools)
1333 Compilation Error in numuCCMultiTargetAnalysis.cxx due to "Protected Variables"
1335 numuCCAnalysis does not fill base(Tracker)Analysis microtree variables
1338 with options HIST and AREA1 markers should not be drawn
1343 highland2 and xsTool seemingly incompatible
1344 ShowerPosition from AnaECALParticleB not properly filled
1345 SetTitle doesn't work for DrawEff / DrawGraph
1349 some toy_index and weight_syst_total are -999
1350 default.GetEntries(signal) differs from truth.GetEntries(signal)
1353 TH1F or TH1D in DrawingTools
1354 get the relative errors with DrawingTools
1355 Discrepancy in the number of entries between default and eff-like trees
1363 Frozen version v2r5 of nd280Highland2 : error at compilation

Main changes: 

- Many improvements in specific selections and systematics
- add fast mechanism to check variable types when Filling at running time. This should solve bug 1341
- remove dependency of highlandTools on  psycheND280Utils by moving the target utilities to psycheND280Utils
- P0DDataClasses: AnaP0DBunch::P0DWaterStatus, AnaP0DParticle::Type, AnaP0DCluster::Moments
- New treatment of RooTrackerVtx variables, which should keep the links when a list of files is used. This required adding new variables
  RooVtxEntry and InputFileNameIndex to AnaSpill. Those variables and manily used for RooTrackerVtx links. THIS IS STILL UNDER TEST !!!!
  However don't save InputFileIndex and RooVtxEntry spill members in the MiniTree for the moment since they produce a seg fault


CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:

psycheCore
--------------

- WeightType: added new operators: +=,  -=
- InputConverter: add _currentFileIndex data member. Make the Reset() method virtual so that the derevied classes
 implementations will be used.

psycheEventModel
-------------------

- BaseDataClasses: Added the DSECAL-FGD2 ToF
- SystId: Pileup -> PileUp for the nue

psycheIO
---------

- info about entries being run will be printed in a centralized place (AnalysisLoop, SimpleLoopBase, ...) 

RedoTreeConverter: 
- Implement a Reset() method that sets the _firstFile data member to
 true so that the branch addresses will be reset when there is a new
 TChain.

psycheSelections
-------------------

- antiNumuCCMultiPi ...: added anti-numu multi-pi selection into psyche (compiles,  does give the output)
- numuCC4Pi: do not apply pile-systematic for branch 1 (bwd track in TPC). the code uses lots of vectors and push_back`s, hence needs a review for psyche usage 
- nue and antiNue: Updates to the (anti-)nue analysis. TPC veto now applied differently for FGD1 and FGD2. Enable ToF cut (fhc only). Add OOFV activity and momentum quality cuts.
 TPC track efficiency syst now applied to all tracks to include latest changes in analysis.
- trackerSelectionUtils: delete properly the arrays (thanks Nick for spotting it)
- gammaFGD2Selection: Added and extra TPC2 veto so that the gammaSelection in FGD2 is orthogonal to FGD1 and things using the FGD2Shower cut (antinue)
  Allow it to calculate the TPC pile up. Added a pair veto in the FGD1 when selecting gamma in the FGD2 to get orthogonal selection.
  changed Pileup -> PileUp for consistancy with other pile up systs


psycheSystematics
------------------

- MomRangeResolSystematics: adopted to work with both FGDs, 2D->3D with the corresponding bins. in UndoSystematic is RangeMomentumMuon the variable that has to be reset
- OOFV: New implementation of OOFV systematic compatible with 4pi selection.
 - Addition of sense concept via IsRelevantRecObjectForSystematicInToy.
 - Proper definition of lastmodule for FGD1.
- ECalPIDSystematics: proper differntiate between eff and 1-eff cases and added some comments about that
- ECalEMEnergyScaleSystematics: when failed to find the proper bin do not proceed further
- ECalTrackEffSystematics: Increase the array to avoid crash.
- MomRangeResol.dat: updated the systematics with some preliminary p6 numbers, 
 FGD1/2-ECal-(SMRD) topologies updated,  iso FGD is pending  but not relevant for the current numu interation
- MomentumResolSystematics: correct bug introduce recently (june 2 2016) preventing the systematic to be undone. 
- SIPionSystematics: the correction is available so do not allow it to be modified by the quality of the systematic, 
 also do not treat in a special way weight=0 zero,  let the downstream code take care (only account for inf/nan case)
- SandMuonsSystematics: Correct bug 1360. Correction weight was not computed
- ECalEmHipPIDSystematics: Generalise the usage of the ECalEmHipPIDSystematics to be applied for tracks as well, not only for showers (similar to the ECalPID).
- ECal_EMHIPPID.dat: Should cover all momentum region.
- PileUpFGD1_p6B.dat PileUpFGD2_p6B.dat : Added the number for the rest of run6 (all are the same, waiting for evaluation)
- FGD2Shower.dat: Update data-mc efficiencies for the nue FGD2Shower systematic.

psycheND280Utils
-----------------
ProtonInteractionSystematic: add #include <cmath> (trying to solve compilation issue in some platform)
ConstituentsUtils.: GetAllTracking(Not)UsingDet() functions moved to SubDetUtils, GetConstituentInDet functionality was lacking P0D


ND280AnalysisUtils: Minor. Be constistent when returning run period for fhc or rhc in runs 5+6.

nueCCUtils, nueCutUtils:
- Update nue utils for the tof and oofv cuts.
- Added FindLe adingTrackInDet to get the leading track in the gamma pairs in FGD1 when the box fv is FGD2,
- Add a warning if the highlandIO.FlatTree.UseReconDirTrackerECal is not turned on - bug 1344.
- Do not use the extended EMEnergy cut for anti-nue. Add some protection for sand muons against the veto cuts.

psycheND280Tools: add class with utilities that can be instantiated from a interactive rood session. In this way we don't need the DrawingTools 
                   to do that. 

psycheSteering
-----------------

AnalysisManager: 
- added new selections available: numu bkg in anti-nu mode, nue, anti-nue and gamma  
   restore some prvious ones for consistency
- Print info about entries being run, not anymore in converters
- Added ToF, EcalEMEnergyScale, EcalEMEnergyResol, ECalPID, TPCECalMatching
  Changed Pileup -> PileUp for the nue 


RunPreloadExample: Move the omp lines to the start of the event loop and add the
 reduction so the npassed counter is correct.

RunExample: Print info about entries being run, not anymore in converters



highlandCore
-----------------

SimpleLoopBase: 
- Initialize, InitializeSpill, Finalize, FinalizeSpill, DefineOutputTree cannot be pure virtual since 
 they are implemented in SimpleLoopBase.cxx. 
- Print info about entries being run, not anymore in converters

AnalysisLoop:

- Properly dump entries being run and percentage, as explained in bug 1332. 
 Also dump here that info, since this is not done in converters anymore
- Fill allways the toy_index variable to address bug 1349
- move RooTrackerVtx stuff to baseAnalysis

OutputManager:
- add fast mechanism to check variable types when Filling at running time. This should solve bug 1341

HighlandInputManager:
- remove DEPRECATED method InputIsoaAnalysisTree(), mark as deprecated for several releases !!!

AnalysisAlgorithm:
- Remove any RooTrackerVtx stuff. Most of it was obsolete. The few remaining things are moved to baseAnalysis


highlandTools
--------------

- remove dependency on psycheND280Utils
- replace floats by double everywhere. Speed nor memory are important here, but precission is
- Now handles properly the NOVARBIN option and variable binnings with 2D histograms

DrawingTools: 
- Use typedef TH1_h and TH2_h such that we can chose between float and double precission (TH1D and TH1F). 
  Correct warning in clang (and probably bug): !uroot_opt.find("BOX") == std::string::npos   ------> uroot_opt.find("BOX") != std::string::npos
- add Draw...Errors methods return now the average differencial error, as suggested in bug 1354
- fix bugs 1338 and 1345
- Initialize the config_tree tools from a file and not from the managers, such that the config tree is also available
- GetNTargets, GetNucleonsPerNucleus, GetAreaFF, DumpFV, DumpVolume, DumpFGDInfo
 moved to psycheND280Tools class under psycheND280Utils. 
 This methods can be instantiated from a root interactive session


DrawingUtils:
- There was a problem with the legend because before the legend is drawn NDC coordinates might have random values. 
 With leg->ConvertNDCtoPad(), we make sure NDC values are correct, and can be properly updated

ConfigTreeTools: add methods to initialize the tools with an input file. 
                Add methods to retrieve variable values from the config tree


highlandEventModel
--------------------

- P0DDataClasses: AnaP0DBunch::P0DWaterStatus, AnaP0DParticle::Type, AnaP0DCluster::Moments
- DataClasses: add RooVtxEntry and InputFileNameIndex to AnaSpill. Those variables and manily used for RooTrackerVtx links.
 don't save InputFileIndex and RooVtxEntry spill members in the MiniTree for the moment since they produce a seg fault


highlandUtils
-------------

- CategToolsNueCC: correct bug detected by warning:  abs(reac < 30)  ---> abs(reac) < 30
- RooTrackerVtxManager: move RooTrackerVtx stuff from OutputManager (which is supposed to be general) to a RooTrackerVtxManager in highlandUtils

highlandIO
-----------

- info about entries being run will be printed in a centralized place (AnalysisLoop, SimpleLoopBase, ...) 

CreateFlatTree.cxx CreateMiniTree.cxx 
- don't AddPackage highlandTools since this is not used anymore by cmt in highlandIO
- use the new RooTrackerVtxManager
- Fill the correct RooVtxEntry depending on whether the RooTrackerVtx tree is saved in the flat tree or not

oaAnalysisTreeConverter

- in genie oa files sometimes the GRooTracker vtx has issues (to be debugged): if so, use TTruthTraj info
- Read P0DWaterStatus from BasicHeaderModule
- Added the DSECAL-FGD2 ToF
- deal with RooVtxEntry and InputFileIndex from AnaSpill

oaAnalysisP0DTreeConverter.cxx 
- Fill several new variables: AnaP0DBunch::P0DWaterStatus, AnaP0DParticle::Type and AnaP0DCluster::Moments 
- build AnaP0DCluster's from clusters and not from nodes for shower-like objects such that moments are available. 
 Change suggested by Zoya. 

DataClassesIO:
- Add RooVtxEntry and InputFileNameIndex of AnaSpill to the FlatTree. Those variables and manily used for RooTrackerVtx links

FlatTreeConverter:
- deal with RooVtxEntry and InputFileIndex from AnaSpill
- Fix a bug while filling the true pion direction (LeptonDir was filled twice)

basP0DAnalysis
--------------

make enums public such that they can be used by any analysis. This should salve bug 1333


baseTrackerAnalysis
--------------------

- make enums public such that they can be used by any analysis. This should salve bug 1333
- nue*Pileup -> nue*PileUp change in SystId

baseAnalysis
-----------------

- We should set RooTrackerVtx stuff to used algorithms. Temporary solution !!!!
  Otherwise the RooVtxEntry is not correct for algorithms using other algorithms
- make enums public such that they can be used by any analysis. This should salve bug 1333
- use the new RooTrackerVtxManager
- move RooTrackerVtx stuff from AnalysisLoop and AnalysisAlgorithm. 
 Add a new test variable RooVtxEntry2, which is filled with GetSpill().RooVtxEntry. 
 In principle the RooVtxEntry of is the same for all vertices in the spill, so probably 
 it can be removed from the vertex
- Add a new variable RooVtxFile, which is filled with  GetSpill().InputFileIndex);
 In this way we have the correct links when a list of files is provided

numuCCAnalysis
---------------

- remove useless code to get the mass weights (which is now in FillConfig)
- add parameter (and code) to set an alternative fiducial volume
- add var truelepton_nuErecQE also in truth tree (reconstructed energy with true lepton kinematics in CCQE formula)

numuCCMultiPiAnalysis
-----------------------

- true_signal is a toy var

nueCCAnalysis
-------------

- Minor updates to incorporate the latest developments in nue selection in psyche.

tutorialAnalysis
-----------------

- Add FillConfigTree example. 
- improve comments.
- Correct warnings

p0dNumuCCAnalysis
-------------------

- Added line to ensure that the energy loss is sensible.
- Class for systematics related to veto track veto cut based on TN-080.
- Migrating OOFV class from p0dNumuCCQEAnalysis to p0dNumuCCAnalysis. Leaving the CCQE version in place for now.
- Added various utilities for selecting various types of veto/sand tracks
- Added OOFV and veto systematics, veto cut, and associated parameters.
 This will increment the accum_level of tracks both here and in p0dNumuCCQAnalysis, so the selection now passes cut3 in CC and cut4 in CCQE.
- Slight modifications to clean up code, fixed a few typos. Cuts should work properly now.

numuCCMultiTargetAnalysis
---------------------------

- fix truelepton_nuErecQEoxygen (it was using the carbon Eb)
- correct warnings

CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:

tutorialAnalysis
-------------------

no changes in code, but many improvements in documentation

p0dNumuCCQEAnalysis
------------------

Updated to work with migration of p0dNumuCCAnalysis to psyche. 
Updated systematics parameter names to match the current naming scheme in highland2.

p0dNumuCCAnalysis
------------------

Most stuff moved to psyche:

- Removed parameters that are now in baseAnalysis, baseTrackerAnalysis, or psyche
- P0D systematics and selections moved to psyche
- DataClasses and converters deprecated by making small changes to existing classes.

nueCCAnalysis
----------------

- Add more true info regarding the paired track from the gamma background.
- add q^2 (true and reco) information and add the inforamtion about the initiator particle for the photon
- correct warning related to unitialized pointers, and put protection when for NULL values

numuCCAnalysis
-----------------

save massWeights for each target and each toy in a single entry tree called massWeightTree, to address bug 1188. 
This is just a prototype !!!

baseTrackerAnalysis
--------------------

- Added P0D+TPC systematics that are now in psyche to the systematics and configurations.
- for the moment keep independent flip kinematics and tof corrections, 
 just add them in a proper order

highlandCorrections
---------------------

FlipKinematicsCorrection, ToFCorrection, ToFCorrection: 
- updated to the changes done to the psycheND280Utils::ToFSenseCorrector, 
 function names,  reutrn values etc
- FlipKinemaitcs: moved the ToF validity checks into the IsRelevant... function, 
 added a warning to highlight the correction is being run (compiled) with recpack enabled
- for the correction, read the parameter on whether to apply the track flip based on ToF from 
 the psyche systematics,  these two are fully related

highlandCorrections.parameters.dat:
- read parameter from pyscheSystematics

highlandIO
--------------

- implement skimming option in all converters

CreateFlatTree, CreateMiniTree:
- for the moment keep independent flip kinematics and tof corrections, 
 just add them in a proper order

oaAnalysisTreeConverter
- Fill P0D segment length and energy/momentum loss
- Try to address bug 1366. 
  + The file is skipped when a file is found without RooTrackerVtx tree, while all others have it
  + The execution stops when Genie and Neut files are mixed
  + The execution stops when a file is found with RooTrackerVtx tree while all others don't have it
- improve error messages related with pressence or nature of RooTrackerVtx tree, to fully solve bug 1372
- for the prod-7 iteration substitute the number of NNodes of tpc constituents with a 
 a sum of fitted horizontal and vertical clusters

FixMergedRooVtxLink: 
- Add the possibility to get the correct RooVtxEntry in the systematic trees
- adapt to genie (if not NRooTrackerVtx look for GRooTrackerVtx)
- set back all_syst as default syst tree

highlandUtils
--------------

- CategToolsNueCC: Fix compilation warnings.
- HighlandTreeConverterUtils: add info about bug 1368 in error output


highlandTools
------------------

DrawingToolsBase, DrawingTools
- enable SetMarkerSize option for 2D histos (bug 1376)
- Now the DrawingTools take the option "RATIO" which draws a data/MC ratio beneath the standard stack plot.
  It's not perfect as the numbers on the y axis are cut.
  Can be used with the root option "SAME" to check the agreement of 2 different sample.
- ofstream ---> std::ofstream
- increase the precision in PrintPurities method (see bug 1385)
- increase precision and pring total number of events passing the cut in PrintPurities method. See bug 1385
- Improve cout in PrintPurities() for Experiment
- use the same format as for experiment in PrintPurities. Don't dump the category by default
- Add user option to the PrintPurities method. 
  Use POT normalization in all methods (including GetEffm GetRatio, DrawErrorsBase, etc). This will be used by default since 
  in general we one to weight the MC according to the POT in its corresponding data period also for efficiencies and errors (see bug 1385)
  This can be disabled with the NOPOTNORM option. 
  Also improves the cout in AnalysisResults
- Add methods DrawToys taking Experiment as argument. See bug 1392
- put the normalization argument allways at the same position: either after the legend when this option is available or after the user option when it is not

WeightTools: 
- Check correctly that NWSi and WSi options are used at the same time. Bug 1393

ConfigTreeTools: 
- forgot to initialize  _fileName and _fromFile in initialize methods of ConfigTreeTools. 
  See comment 73 in bug 1188

DrawingUtils:
- GetBinWidth does not exist for a 2D histo. Must get the axis first:
  h->GetBinWidth(i+1)   --->    h->GetXaxis()->GetBinWidth(i+1);
- add option NOPOTNORM to disable POT normalization
- add RELATIVE option
- add method to get the value of an integer variable from the trees in a Experiment. All MC samples in all sample groups should have the same value. Otherwise it complains

rootmap_setup: 
- reflect the fact that highlandTools now depends only on highñlandCore and psycheCore
- remove PSYCHEND280UTILSROOT stuff

requirements 
- remove make_fragment stuff since there are no fragments for this package


highlandEventModel
-------------------

- P0DDataClasses: Length now in AnaP0DParticleB, so I removed the inheritance from AnaSubTrack, which is just a container for length.
- requirements: remove make_fragment stuff since there are no fragments for this package

highlandCore
---------------

- OutputManager: add NMAXSPECIALTREES (=20). All trees with index below NMAXSPECIALTREES are considered special trees
- AnalysisLoop: add functionality to use a file with events to skim. micro-trees start at index NMAXSPECIALTREES
- HighlandInputManager: use psyche InputManager in the LoadSpill method
- requirements: remove make_fragment stuff since there are no fragments for this package

psycheSteering
----------------

- RunPreloadExample: Don't use nmax_events/nCores (nmax_events may be -1) to calculate how manycontiguous iterations.
- RunExpPreloadExample: Count how many events pass the selection.
- RunSyst: Update the parameter names. Add counters to show the numbers of events passing the cuts.
- requirements: remove make_fragment stuff since there are no fragments for this package


psycheSystematics
--------------------

 BFieldDistortionSystematics,  ChargeIDEffSystematics, TPCClusterEffSystematics, TPCPIDSystematics: Added P0DFV+TPC tracks to relevant track groups.
- MomentumResolSystematics: Added new parameter to always use the TPC-based smearing if the P0D FV is being used.
- MomentumScaleSystematics: Added new parameter to use a slightly different smearing if the P0D FV is being used: use the global momentum with the P0D energy loss removed.
 In general, it might be better for all tracks to apply the smearing to the TPC recon momentum from the nearest TPC (analogous to the MomentumResolSystematics TPC-based smearing).
- P0DVetoSystematics: P0D+TPC1 veto/pileup/sand muon/cosmic systematic. Data calculated for prod. 6B runs 1-4. Runs 5-7 not done yet.
 This acts as a weight correction/systematic for the P0D veto cut in p0dNumuCCSelection.
- P0DELossResolSystematics, P0DELossScaleSystematics: P0D energy/momentum loss scale and resolution. Energy loss is defined in data converters as the difference
 between the global front momentum and the momentum at the detector crossing into TPC1.
 Data calculated from Run 4 data and particle gun MC for P0D-stopping FGD cosmics. Currently, use the same throws for water and air and use only one bin in
 P0D segment length, but this could be improved.
- ToFResolSystematics: adopted to the changes implemented for ToFSenseCorrector, 
 use a parameter to check whether to flip a track (tmp and the moment! since needs special treatment throughout the downstream code of 
 oveall psyche)
- nueOOFVSystematics: Update reco categories to match the numu oofv. Remove unused variables. Event weight is defined as Weight_h and is splitted in Systematic and Correction.

- psycheSystematics.parameters.dat: Added new parameter to be read by momentum systematics to run the correct smearing to P0D FV tracks.
 Added new parameter to control whether the ToF should do any track flipping (will be read by highland as well)
 OFF by default,   since things to discuss and have settled  
- requirements: remove make_fragment stuff since there are no fragments for this package


psycheSelections
--------------------

- trackerSelectionUtils: Added a few lines to make FindLeadingTracks work with the P0DFV+Good quality TPC group
- p0dNumuCCSelection: P0D+TPC1 numu CC inclusive selection. Psyche equivalent to TN-080 selection (not identical but should be very close).
 Could still add muon PID cut to increase muon purity (doesn't change selection purity much in FHC beam mode). Simple selection to use as a
  base for exclusive samples or to extract CC inclusive results on water.
- antiNueCCSelection: Minor correction in the way the FGD2Shower systematic is applied. Remove unused variables.
- antiNueCCFGD2Selection: Rename class EOverPCut -----> EOverPCutFGD2.
- psycheSelections.parameters.dat: remove unused parameters 


psycheIO
-----------

- RedoTreeConverter: Fill new P0D variables (length & energy loss) in RedoTreeConverter
- MiniTreeConverter: implement skimming option


psycheND280Utils
-------------------

- EventBoxTracker, EventBoxUtils, ConstituentsUtils: 
  + Added four rec. object groups and three true object groups: for P0D tracks:
  + Also added functions to fill these in ConstituentsUtils (trajectories) and EventBoxUtils (rec objects) and
    modified boxUtils::FillTracksWithTPC to fill groups if the P0D is the subdetector being used. 
  + Fixed bug causing errors when filling P0D true trajectories.
- CutUtils: Added some functions for a P0D veto cut. The cut creates a box around the standard fiducial volume (limits currently hard coded)
 and vetoes bunches where a track starts outside the box and ends inside.
- ToFSenseCorrector: started to review the logic and the names. review the satic-ness and const-ness of functions
- nueCCUtils: Add a protection against tracks going in the Ecal but no ecal information is available. Remove unused variables. Small change in the way the FGD2Shower cut is applied.
- FluxWeighting:
 + FluxTuning now optionally takes a 'planeident' parameter.
 + Can specifiy nd6/nd13 (magnet/sand) neutrino plane
 + Constructor arguments are now const references... saving the world
   one std::string copy at a time.
 + Also recieved a clang-format.

psycheUtils
---------------

BinnedParams:  ifstream --> std::ifstream

psycheEventModel
------------------

- BaseDataClasses: Added P0D segment length & energy loss to AnaP0DParticleB.
- SampleId, SistId: Added flags P0D Numu CC selection and several P0D systematics.
- requirements: remove make_fragment stuff since there are no fragments for this package

psycheCore
-------------


InputConverter: 
- add an screen message in IsCorrectType of this kind: "- Converter 'oaAnalysisTree' looking for tree 'ReconDir/Global' --> Yes"
 such that in the case all trees are missing the user knows what is going on (see bug 1366)
- improve error messages by adding ERROR to the begining
- iftream --> std::ifstream

CoreUtils:
- add method to skip events provided a file with a list of "run subrun evt". To be revisited

requirements: 
- remove make_fragment stuff since there are no fragments for this package

   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

FREEZE FOR BANFF DEVELOPMENT

MAIN CHANGES:

- antiNueCCAnalysis and gammaAnalysis added to nd280Highland2
- many improvements in documentation. Put many things in the code and use snippet commands to retrieve it
- many improvements in the validation, including new tests for nue, psycheSteering and RooTrackerVtx.
  All packages in nd280Highland2 are at least checked for compilation
- remove zero_var configuration since we now apply all weights also in the default tree
- correct memory leak in ResizeArray
- started general cleanup/coding optimizaiton. 
  template all the Copy/Resreve/Resize/CreateArray methods, 
- Improvements in many systematics and new systematic: MomBiasFromVertexMigration
- Correct several bugs in numuCCMultiPiSelection, and changes in many other selections, specially nue related


CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:



baseAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------


- remove zero_var configuration since we now apply all weights also in the default tree

baseAnalysis.parameters.dat 
- improvements in doxygen documentation

baseAnalysis: 
- In FillTruthTree: Sometimes the same true vertex is asigned to the candidate in another bunch, most likely because of a delayed track. In this case 
  save the higher accum level into the true vertex. This should solve the discrepancies between truth tree and default trees for the number of 
  selected signal events
- implement the temporary solution for RooTrackerVtx also in Initialize method since it needs to be called after all used analyses have been decleared

make enums public such that they can be used by any analysis. This should salve bug 1333

highlandTools
------------------------------------------------------

- improvements in doxygen documentation
- remove zero_var configuration since we now apply all weights also in the default tree
- added MomBiasFromVertexMigration systematic
- Fixed typo using systematics enum when enabling systematics------------------------------------------------------

AnalysisLoop: 
 - uncomment  ND::params().LoadParametersFiles(anaUtils::GetPackageHierarchy(), true);
   was commented out because the GetPackageHierarchy() method was in psycheUtils, while highlandCore does not depend on 
   that package anymore. So we have now move this method (and the ones used by it) to CoreUtils in psycheCore

AnalysisAlgorithm.hxx AnalysisLoop.cxx 
- improvements in doxygen documentation

VersionManager:
- add method to get the version of a specific package
- add VersionManager_LinkDef.h 


highlandIO
------------------------------------------------------

FlatTreeConverter, oaAnalysisTreeConverter 
- use new ResizeArray() method


highlandTools
------------------------------------------------------

improvements in doxygen documentation

DrawingTools, WeightTools, SystematicTools
- added a protection so not to apply the method ApplyWeights() more than once

ConfigTreeTools:
- add gifts methods GetWeightName and GetNWeights as suggested in bug 1188
- add a preprocessing variable to be used in xsTool

DrawingToolsBase:
- add ver() method to return the Versioning singleton. 
- attemp to solve bug 1402 about the RATIO option

DrawingUtils: 
- I didn't find yet the proper way of checking the existence of NDC coordinates. 
  The new solution seems to work for the moment


highlandUtils
------------------------------------------------------

CategToolsNueCC:
- Check that there is gamma only in the selected fgd. Small correction in the way signal is defined.

P0DAnalysisUtils: 
- use templates from CoreUtils for Resize/Create/CopyArray() methods
  for CopyArray() account to the new "consistent" (throughout the classes) changes
   of arguments` order: (src, target, size)

IntersectionUtils:
- various useful classes functions that allow to check/get the enrtrance&exit
  points of the intersection of a ray with a 3D box (axis oriented)  
  useful for pthoton systematics estimations and possibly some neutrino checks as
  well, 

  the deeper functionality can be retrieved with highlandRecPack (via RECPACK) but 
  usage of the RECPACK is considered to be something not generalized and for only
  specific case,  hence introduced something simplier

  may be useful for checks/systematics by Pierre Lasorak for photons 


highlandValidation
------------------------------------------------------

- add tests for nue, for the moment without systematics
- add tests for psycheSteeering: comparison of events passing selection for each branch and performance comparison 
- add tests for RooTrackerVtx
- Add jenkins automation scripts: highland-build.sh highland-validation.sh nd280-build.sh process-nominal.sh 

process-nominal.sh
- don't put the ouput directory inside data
- put code for nominal in a different folder (NOMINAL)

highland-build.sh 
- Change highland-build.sh to perform cmt br make only over psyche/highland2 packages (for some reason nd280AnalysisTools was getting stuck)

process.py:
- simplify get_to_process and further improvements for psyche validation

validation_utils.py 
- add _syst_ to the output file name only for p0danalyses and systematics parameters files

config.py 
- with flattree.parameters.dat for flat tree creation since the tracker ecal module is needed 

requirements 
- add all packages in nd280Highland2 such that at least we validate the compilation

systematics.parameters.dat 
- the multipi selection needs the tracker ecal module

flattree.parameters.dat 
- switch on the dir tracker ecal parameter


numuCCMultiTargetAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

- Add variable "selmu_hit1_fgdmoduletype" in DefineMicroTree to make it run
- This should solve bug 1403. must call baseTrackerAnalysis::Initialize() and the end of Initialize(). 
  It was not called before. It has to be at the end such that usedAlgorithms are declared. It will be in baseAnalysis where the RooTrackerVtx stuff is handled 


p0dNumuCCAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

- p0dNumuCCAnalysis: remove zero_var configuration since we now apply all weights also in the default tree


p0dNumuCCQEAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

- p0dNumuCCQEAnalysis: remove zero_var configuration since we now apply all weights also in the default tree


tutorialAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

- many improvements in doxygen documentation
- add  < highlandIO.FlatTree.UseReconDirTrackerECal = 1 > 
  such that the user does not have to modify highlandIO.parameters.dat


psycheCore
------------------------------------------------------

Deprecated.hxx 
 - added DEPRECATED_VERBOSE macro so one can add a certain message as well
 - make some trick (variadic stuff) to add overloading to the macro, 
 - now can be used with the same name (DEPRECATED) with and w/o a message


CoreUtils: 
- move GetSoftwareVersionFromPath, GetPackageNameFromProgram, GetPackageNameFromPath and GetPackageHierarchy to 
  from AnalysisUtils in psycheUtils to CoreUtils in psycheCore such that they can be used from highlandCore. 
  Anyway, those methods are general, assuming a CMT structure
- started general cleanup/coding optimizaiton
  template all the Copy/Resreve/Resize/CreateArray methods, 
  keep only those that are type specific (e.g. provide some default as a parameter)
- CopyArray() ! an important change: modify all the methods,  so that the
  structure is (source, target, size): previousely there were differences
  depending on the types used
- ResizeArray methods now take the original size as an additional parameter and
  use proper C++ style of creating a new array so that the memory usage is not
  corrupted due to a mixture of C (reallocate) and C++ (delete) methods
  it can be a bit slower but is used generally only on event level

EventVariationBase.cxx EventWeightBase.cxx
- adopted to the changes in CoreUtils 


psycheEventModel
------------------------------------------------------

SystId: 
- new systematic: MomBiasFromVertexMigration 
- the order was changed (indices), hence affects random seeds used for validation (can
  trivially change), but guess it is better to keep everything in some logical order

BasicUtils: 
- adopted to changes in psycheCore/CoreUtils.(h)cxx
  template all the Copy/Resreve/Resize/CreateArray methods,  
  keep only those that are type specific (e.g. provide some default as a
  parameter)

- CopyArray() ! an important change: modify all the methods,   so that the
  structure is (source,  target,  size): previousely there were differences
  depending on the types used

- ResizeArray() methods now take the original size as an additional parameter and
  use proper C++ style of creating a new array so that the memory usage is not
  corrupted due to a mixture of C (reallocate) and C++ (delete) methods
  it can be a bit slower but is used generally only on event level)))))


psycheIO
------------------------------------------------------

RedoTreeConverter:
- added ECAL variables (which I guess are relevant for BANFF), 
  to be reviewed as for the rest of detectors:
  need to split properly the reading between psycheIO RedoConverter and highlandIO
  FlatTreeConverter
- use the new ResizeArray() method that takes into account the original size of
  the array


psycheND280Utils
------------------------------------------------------

add rootmap stuff such that psycheND280Tools is visible from a root session

ND280AnalysisUtils:
- fix GetNTargets for fgd2xylike when using a FV different from default, and make fgd2watermodules being the exact sum of fgdwaterlike and virtual xy

EventBoxUtils:
- adopted to changes in psycheCore/CoreUtils.(h)cxx and
  psycheEventModel/BasicUtils.(h)cxx related to the arrays

nueCCUtils:
- Minor. Update warning when the ecal variables are not found.
- Minor. Update ToF.


psycheSelections
------------------------------------------------------

- use the new ResizeArray method that takes original size of the array as an argument
- when looking for ECal pi-0 candidates use new method in cutUtils. hence got rid of its actual copy from the packages
- FindEcalPhotonsAction: prod5cut was obsolete and not used --> got rid of it
  make all the cut params (e.g. upstream layer) protected

numuCCSelection.hxx 
- added BasicUtils dependency so that it is propagated to many of the dependents
- improvements in doxygen documentation

numuCCMultiPiSelection: 
- ccmultipibox->nIsoEcals must be initialized to 0 for each toy. Although this could be optimised since 
  we don't expect the number of iso tracks to change from one toy to another
- Fix error on the increasing number of Pi0EcalTracks
- Change MostUpstreamLayerHit type from bool to int
- minor,  for consistency set the nPi0Ecaltracks counter to zero in the method as well
- IsECALPi0Object --> IsECALPi0Photon
- get rid of vector usage, use ClearArray methods wherever possible, need to review the usage of the fixed sized arrays!
- improvements in doxygen documentation

psycheSelections.parameters.dat 
- Remove unused parameter.
- Minor. Update ToF.

nueCCSelection: 
- Reverse the logic when looking for a systematic in IsRelevantSystematic. Move the minimum momentum cut after the PID, to make sure that it is always included when CheckRedoSelection is called.
- No need to call for the TPC quality cut from the parameters file.

gammaSelection, gammaFGD2Selection 
- Move the minimum momentum cut after the PID, to make sure that it is always included when CheckRedoSelection is called. Properly fill summary action for FGD2 selection.
- Apply option for systematics fine tuning. Systematics properly applied to both electron tracks.
- No need to call for the TPC quality cut from the parameters file.

numuCCBwdSelection: 
- remove obsolete selection, fully included into numu CC 4pi. approved by Pierre Bartet

antiNumuCCMultiPiSelection:
- started code review/cleanup. use ClearArray methods wherever possible, need to review the need/speed of the usage of fixed sized arrays
- got rid of push_ backs (a)
- stating getting rid of  any stuff beyoned plansearrays (on-going)
- this is the verbosity-based commit, 
  but it is important to mention that the
  recent bugs (treatment of the most MostUpstreamtLayer etc have been fixed th
  reflect the changes/fixes in CC multi-pi )
- use ClearArray() methods, 
  minor: for consistency set counters to zero in the methods as well (are reset in
  the Reset() method anyway)
- IsECALPi0Object --> IsECALPi0Photon

psycheSystematics
------------------------------------------------------

- MomentumResolSystematics, PileUpSystematics: improvements in doxygen documentation
- MomBiasFromVertexMigrationSystematics: systematic to account for momentum bias due to vertex migration:is supposed to be binned in mom and angle (costheta) bins
- MomentumScaleSystematics: propagate the systematic for the flipped momentum as well
- ECalPIDSystematics, ECalEmHipPIDSystematics, ECalEMEnergyResolSystematics, ECalEMEnergyScaleSystematics: Do not evaluate systematic if the ecal variables have unphysical values (for example negative energy), see bug 1390.
- TPCECalMatchEff.dat: Update TPCECalMatchEff systematic. New numbers with update binning and update event selection. Numbers provided by Andy Chappell.
- BFieldDistortionSystematics: propagate the systematics to the momentum flipped as well (use TPC with most nodes closest to the track end point). generalize the methods + some clean-up
- TPCPIDSystematics: Fix typo for P0D. 
- ECalEMEnergyResol.dat: Update ECalEMEnergyResol based on TN-279.
- ChargeIDEffSystematics: use new ResizeArray() method

AnalysisUtils: 
- move GetSoftwareVersionFromPath, GetPackageNameFromProgram, GetPackageNameFromPath and GetPackageHierarchy to 
  from AnalysisUtils in psycheUtils to CoreUtils in psycheCore such that they can be used from highlandCore. 
  Anyway, those methods are general, assuming a CMT structure

   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

FREEZE FOR BANFF DEVELOPMENT with no nd280AnalysisTools

MAIN CHANGES:

- removed nd280AnalysisTools dependency ( finally !!!!), instead oaAnalysisReader is intruduced
- improve Versioning
- highlandSystematics, a new package for common systemnatics that are not part pof psyche
- some changes in nue related selections

The rest are minor changes



CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:


nd280Psyche
------------------------------------------------------


Minor changes in most packages

- psycheND280AnalysisTools: fix number of targets for water modules
- psycheSelections: accept events below 200 MeV in nue related selections
- psycheSystematics: TPC PID should also include electrons with p < 200. For now, this is the same as the next bin (200-400).
- psycheUtils: Add methods to deal directly with AnaParticleB without any casting. The methods with tracks should be removed at some point.
  This tries to address bug 1397


oaAnalysisReader
-----------------------------------------------------

This package does part of what nd280AnalysisTools used to do for highland
In particular it provide oaAnalysis classes through MakeProject. 
This root commant is not run on the fly but instead the classes for different relevant productions are 
provided in different folders: prod5D, prod5F, prod6B and prod6TREx. 
By default prod6B is used in the requirements file. 

Also a script createProd.py is provided to automatically create a production folder, provided the folder name and a root file


highlandSystematics
-----------------------------------------------------


A new package dedicated to be a roof for various systematics
developed inside highland but not subject to be migrated into psyche (i.e. oscillation 
analysis fitters` usage):
a good example are various systematics developed for cross-section analysis

for the moment keep the systematics related to smearing due to an uknown position 
of the parent decay (i.e. neutrino direction effectively), although the latter
still lacks the proper inputs

More to come


highlandCore
-----------------------------------------------------

AnalysisLoop: 
- remove commented lines. 
- Call ana().InitializeBase() after ana.Initialize()

AnalysisAlgorithm
- Set the initial analysisPoint as kConstructor. 
- Don't allow calls to UseAnalysis after Initialize
- Proper ordering in analysis points enum, starting by kConstructor. 
- Add pure virtual method InitializeBase


baseAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

baseAnalysis: 
- Add non virtual InitializeBase method such that it cannot be overwritten by derived classes. This ensures this method is always called 
 by AnalysisLoop. Is in this method where the   SetSaveRooTracker and SetRooVtxManager are called, such that those settings are propagated to usedAlgorithms, 
 which are declared in Initialize() the lastest. New implementation for those two methods, which now propagate the settings to used algorithms
- add PROD5D
- add production 6HI (the TREX mini production). Rename PROD6BC to PROD6BD

RunRooTrackerVtxExample: 
- #include "AnalysisTools/libReadoaAnalysis/libReadoaAnalysisProjectHeaders.h"
  -->  #include "oaAnalysisReaderProjectHeaders.h"


numuCCAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

added the positions of true letpon entrance and exit points for each TPC
this is useful to undestand the loss of the selection efficiencies (and possible
reco failures/limitations)


highlandIO
------------------------------------------------------


- Import nd280AnalysisTools functionality needed by highland2 to highland2

oaAnalysisTreeConverter: 
- create the _ecalPidCalc and initialize it. I don't know whether this has ever worked !!!
- use the updated pre-processor definitions from the Versioning:
 prod7 development and trex prod6-based mini production

CreateFlatTree.cxx CreateMiniTree.cxx highlandIO.parameters.dat  
- do not apply UseGlobalAltMomCorrection since this is analysis dependent. It should be applied at analysis level

DataClassesIO:
- remove !defined ANATOOLS_FILE_VERSION warnigs, since 
 with oaAnalysisReader ANATOOLS_FILE_VERSION is removed, the version is always defined



highlandUtils
------------------------------------------------------

P0DAnalysisUtils: 
- Adding Geomtery Utilities to convert GeomID to SP0Dule, P0Dule, Layer and Bar Number. 
  This is the same calculation as done in SetupP0DTree.H in p0dRecon. 
  Also, correction for minTime/maxTime which was swtiched for Michel Electron clusters.

HighlandAnalysisUtils: 
- add PROD5D
- rename 6BC --> 6BD
- handle TREx production

requirements 
- add root libraries needed by TECALPid stuff, imported from nd280AnalysisTools

TECALPidDefs, TTruthUtils
- import TECALPid... files  and TTruthUtils from nd280AnalysisTools

ecalRecon_likelihood_pdfs ...
- add ecal likelihood pdfs temporarily under src and set the proper folder in the manager

CategToolsNueCC
- IsGammaSignalOOFGD is separated between FGD1 and FGD2. Update NuESimpleCat.


highlandEventModel
------------------------------------------------------

requirements 
- use highland2/oaAnalysisReader instead of nd280AnalysisTools

Versioning: 
- use EQUALS_... instead BEAFORE_... when possible. Add info about each production from t2k.org
- #include "AnalysisTools/libReadoaAnalysis/libReadoaAnalysisProjectHeaders.h"
  -->  #include "oaAnalysisReaderProjectHeaders.h"
- add PROD5D
- added new special case:  VERSION_PROD6HI for prod6 TREx based iteration
- nd280AnalysisTools --> oaAnalysisReader
- remove ANATOOLS_FILE_VERSION and ANATOOLS_FILE_PROD5. 
 The version will be always defined
- added new stuff to treat the obsolete vars removed/changed from oaAnalysis
related to ECal lhood pid calculations and ttruthutils

P0DDataClasses:
- added OriginalP0D for momentum from range systematic


highlandValidation
------------------------------------------------------

- Fix problems with production5 validation
- Changes related to nd280AnalysisTools removal

config.py
- set  v2r11p1 as nominal
- temporarily use the flatree parameters file for numu such that  < highlandIO.FlatTree.UseReconDirTrackerECal = 0 >

test.py
- truemu_momt --> truelepton_momt

pyutils.tar.gz 
- add new method oaAnalysisReader_prod in tianlu/analysis/utils.py to get the production from the oaAnalysisReader requirements file.

requirements

MAIN CHANGES:

- Try to address bug 1152, about indexing params in systematics
- improve Versioning
- highlandSystematics, a new package for common systemnatics that are not part pof psyche
- Improvements in documentation

CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:


nd280Psyche
------------------------------------------------------

- psycheCore: some simplification/reorganization in SelectionBase and Step base to allow implementation of Delete, Replace and Insert Step methods
- psycheEventModel: remove methods that were deprecated for a while
- psycheUtils: Mainly try to address bug 1152, about indexing params in systematics
- psycheND280AnalysisTools: first version of alternative true michel electron counter (bug 1273). Update runid for Run7 data. MC is not yet updated as there is no Run7 MC available.
- psycheSelections: in trackerSelectionUtils mark FindLeadingTracksOld as deprecated 
- psycheSystematics: address bug 1152 for many systematics. In TPCECalMatchEffSystematics replace track->Momentum with track->MomentumEnd (bug 1361)
 In MichelElectronEffSystematics fix a typo to use proper indices when applying weights, the ones with offsets

oaAnalysisReader
-----------------------------------------------------

- added prod6E and prod6G
- Install the ND__*.h headers in to the binary folder (?)
- in requirements file add table with correspondence between a given production, the oaAnalysis version used for that production
 and the oaAnalysisReader subfolder to be used

highlandSystematics
-----------------------------------------------------

A new package dedicated to be a roof for various systematics
developed inside highland but not subject to be migrated into psyche (i.e. oscillation 
analysis fitters` usage):
a good example are various systematics developed for cross-section analysis

for the moment keep the systematics related to smearing due to an uknown position 
of the parent decay (i.e. neutrino direction effectively), although the latter
still lacks the proper inputs


highlandCore
-----------------------------------------------------

VersionManager: make it more rational and user friendly. A production version has a nd280 and oaAnalysis version, and not a low and high version as before. 


highlandEventModel
-----------------------------------------------------

DataClasses*:
 - Adds P7Dev global ECal segment variables. Protected by preprocessor.

*_LinkDef.h:
 - Adds ROOT recommended pre-amble to stop over-dictionary generation.

Versioning: 
- Improve documentation about versions.
- Define a new variable VERSION_HAS_NUMBER_OF_FITTED_CLUSTERS such that
 we don't use VERSION_PROD... preprocessor variables outside Versionin.hxx.


highlandTools
-----------------------------------------------------

DrawingTools: test implementation of methods using default/truth to compute efficiencies, instead of truth only. See bug 1406

baseAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

- call the new method AddStandardProductions in ProductionUtils.
- Move all code from Initialize to InitializeBase, since the last is always called from AnalysisLoop (not overwritten by derived classes)
 will the former is ussualy overwritten and could not be called in analysis using others

numuCCAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

numuCCAnalysis: add commented line to enable categories for the bkg (anti) numu contamination 
(todo: worth having a parameter to enable them)

highlandIO
------------------------------------------------------

CreateFlatTree, CreateMiniTree
- call the new method AddStandardProductions in ProductionUtils.

DataClassesIO
- Clang-format, no other changes.

oaAnalysisTreeConverter
- Adds P7Dev global ECal segment variables. Protected by preprocessor.
- clang-format only. I cannot deal with it! (no other changes).
- don't use VERSION_PROD... preprocessor variables outside Versionin.hxx. Instead define a new variable
 VERSION_HAS_NUMBER_OF_FITTED_CLUSTERS



highlandUtils
------------------------------------------------------

CategToolsNueCC:
- Update categories to include genie channels not simulated in neut. Correctly name anti-nue categories.

Working file: highland2/highlandUtils/v2r14/src/CategoriesUtils.cxx
- add particle_detector category as suggested in bug 1413
- correct bug 1413 by assigning code 999 (CATOTHER) to the detector cathegory when the detector is not found in TreeConverterUtils
- remove methods that were deprecated for a while

HighlandAnalysisUtils:
- Production version stuff noved into a different utility files: ProductionUtils.cxx/.hxx

P0DAnalysisUtils: 
- remove methods that were deprecated for a while

ProductionUtils
- Production version stuff noved from HighlandAnalysisUtils into a different utility files: ProductionUtils.cxx/.hxx
 Add more productions. Use directly version and revision numbers instead of preprocessor variables


tutorialAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

tutorialBranchesSelection: Don't use GetAllTracks methods in selections. Instead use the EventBox


highlandValidation
------------------------------------------------------

config.py: change nominal to v2r13
process-nominal.sh: setup the python scripts

MAIN CHANGES:

- Solve important bug (1425): selected events was all_syst is always less than in default tree
- Documentation now resides under highlandDoc and highlandND280Doc packages
- new flux tunning from july 2016
- oaAnalysisReader for Prod7 RC1


CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:

nd280Psyche
------------------------------------------------------

- psycheSelections: changes only in nue/gamma selections, mainly simplifications. Also vetoes added to gamma selection
- psycheND280Utils: many changes, including improvements in Flux weight treatment, that now is controled from there.
                   Add latest flux files from july 2016, including run7, at tuned13av1.1_july2016
- psycheSystematics: in FGDECalMatchEffSystematics, MomRangeResolSystematics Try to address bug 1197
                    using the new groups kTracksWithFGD1AndTECALInFGD1FV and kTracksWithFGD2AndTECALInFGD2FV
- psycheSteering: centralise the  Flux file parameters in psycheND280Utils


oaAnalysisReader
-----------------------------------------------------

Adds Prod7 RC1 production. This is likely to be the final Prod7 version
unless bugs are found. It includes update ECal objects in the global tree
as well as trajectory points for SI reweighting.

highlandCore
-----------------------------------------------------

AnalysisLoop: 

Add  solution to bug 1425. The check on the accum level to be saved is only done at the toy level. Then if any of the toys 
has to be saved the whole event is saved in FillMicroTrees. With this changes the toys seem to be distribute correctly around the default, 
and the results do not depend on the min accum level to save parameter 


highlandEventModel
-----------------------------------------------------

Add mainpage.dox so that highlandEventModel can be \ref'ed

highlandTools
-----------------------------------------------------

DrawingTools, DrawingToolsBase 
- Improvements in the way normalization factors are treated. Now it is possible to 
 provide a factor for the first sample (ussually the real data), which can be treated as a POT value if the 
 POTNORM option is given, just as for the MC. For more details https://bugzilla.nd280.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1295
 At the moment this is only available for Draw methods with two trees or two DataSamples. Missing for SampleGroup, Experiment, eff/ratio methods, 
 etc

- Also the pot_norm argument is removed from GetNormalisationFactor method, and most Draw methods, since it was not used
- add GetLastStackTotal2D for TH2. clean GetLastStackTotal code

DrawingUtils: 
- improve doc for POTNORM option


baseAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

- remove weight variable from micro-trees since flux and pileup are now in weight_corr variable
- centralise the  Flux file parameters in psycheND280Utils


highlandIO
------------------------------------------------------

CreateMiniTree:
- Adds parameter highlandIO.MiniTree.ForceSaveAll, which if set
 overrides all Truth and recon switches. Will still remove recon
 bunches with absolutely nothing in them.

oaAnalysisTreeConverter:
- All segments now have their truth info set in:
 oaAnalysisTreeConverter::FillSubdetectorTrackInfo
 Previously it seemed that only TPC segments and full
 global objects go their truth info set. This made
 making plots of bad global matches fairly impossible...

- Adds parameter
 highlandIO.oaAnalysis.ForceIgnoreRunNumberClash
 which shuts up the message and stops early exit if
 subsequent files have colliding run numbers.

 Off by default but if you're lazy and have a load
 of particle guns with different seeds but the same
 run IDs it beats regenerating...

- Replaces TruthVertices/RooTracker energy check with
 one that uses numeric_limits to define a sensible
 epsilon.

 Shuts up annoying every vertex error message about 
 energy difference for vertices that cannot find their
 rooTracker vertex... for example if you are running a PGun.

- Fixes compiler error that I didn't notice because I committed the 8th
 unforgivable sin of committing before compiling.


highlandIO.parameters.dat 
- add lines needed for doxygen documentation. 
 Add comments in latest parameters added
 
highlandUtils
------------------------------------------------------

CategToolsNueCC: 
- No need to define again the NOTRUTH topology. This will solve a harmless(?) error printed when running nue analysis.


highlandDoc & highlandND280Doc
------------------------------------------------------

new packages for highland documentation

highlandValidation
------------------------------------------------------

tests.py: don't test "weight" variable, which has being removed from the trees. 
          Also truelepton_costheta since it is different for nue

CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:

nd280Psyche
------------------------------------------------------

pyscheCore:
- SelectionBase: for the fitters related methods: FillEventSummary() and GetSampleId(),
  make them "pure virtual" for the moment to force the selections aimed to be used by fitters to implement them
  Although should be careful with the design since:
  InitializeEvent(),  DefineDetectorFV(),
  FillEventSummary() and GetSampleId() do not seem to be mandatory
  to organize/develop a general selection (e.g. in highland)
- many more changes (look at the package freeze message)

psycheIO:
- RedoTreeConverter: move dealing with AnaTrigger vars (FGD/TtipT cosmics trigger)
 into highlandIO,  a proper cleanup to split psyche/highland2 vars is still
 pending

psycheUtils:
- new method anaUtils::GetAllTracksUsingOnlyDetFromList()

psycheND280Utils:
- add latest flux files from july 2016, including run7
- centralise the selection of Flux parameters here
- unify multi-pi selections by putting the cuts in CutUtils
- many more changes (look at the package freeze message)

psycheSelections:
- All selections: Use the proper method to be overloaded from the SelectionBase
 to retrieve the SampleId:
 SampleId_h GetSampleId() instead of SampleId::SampleEnum GetSampleEnum()
- All MultiPi Selections: multi-pi unification with the usage of general cuts from CutUtils
- many more changes (look at the package freeze message)

psycheSystematics
- centralise the  Flux file parameters in psycheND280Utils
- ECalPID.dat, ECal_EMHIPPID.dat; Fix typos in the Ecal PID systematics.
- ToFResolution.dat: Errors obtained comparing ToF between NEUT-6B and RDP-6K

psycheSteering:
- Now listen to the parameter file for systematics (bug 1437)
- centralise the  Flux file parameters in psycheND280Utils


highlandCore
-----------------------------------------------------

OutputManager:
- replace GetCurrentTree() method by _current_tree such that it is a bit faster, mainly related with the var type checking
- optimize the variable type checking, related to bug 1341

highlandEventModel
-----------------------------------------------------

DataClasses: 
- AnaTrueVertex: changed the description of Proton and Pion kinematic vars
 since the most energetic one is actually used
- AnaTrigger: added a function to check whether a certain bit is set for CTM trigger pattern
- added variables related to trigger and TripT CTM trigger info. Not saved into the MiniTree for the moment since it gives problems

P0DDataClasses: 
- Adding Cycle variable to AnaP0DCluster class


highlandTools
-----------------------------------------------------

DrawingTools, DrawingToolsBase: 
- Many simplifications and code cleaning. Introduce common utility methods that will be used to simplify the code.
- Add methods DrawToys which allow setting the binning
- GetMinAccumLevelToSave should return the higher MinAccumLevelToSave among all data samples in the experiment.
- solve bug 1014 by checking the min accum level for each sample in the Experiment.
- Improve enormously all Draw...VSCut methods by unifitying all of them and making sure
 that all options work correctly.
- rationalize the use of GetSameLevel(), being centralized in few methods
- further simplification. All methods return use now a copy of the matrix and not a reference.
 Use the method TMatrixD GetSystematicCovBase(HistoStack* hs1, HistoStack* hs2, const std::string& uopt, const std::string& group);
 that is valid both for ratios and single tree/samples
- Cannot call drawUtils::ContainValidOptions(uopt) after adding some internal options to uopt
- Unify methods drawing errors and cov matrices. They all use now the same intermediate methods GetCovMatrixHistoStack.
 Also the treatment is the same for tree and Experiment
- 2D histos must be saven in _saved_histos2D and not in _saved_histos. There were crashes sometimes because of that.
 Don't show the stats box for 2D histos
- bug 1331.  auto labels only for 1D ( for the moment).
 The auto title in Y is only used in DrawHistoStack, but also set into the HistoStack itself such that it works when plotting stacked histograms
- For 2D histos the box option should only be applied when the option NODATA is used, otherwise
 the color bar for the colz option does not appear. This should solve bug 1374

DrawingUtils:
- Added to the DrawingTools ability to apply the external weights with some options to include/exclude particular weights
- get the units from inside the [ ], as suggested in bug 1331
- All related to bug 1331
 Add GetAutoTitleY method, which returs the title in Y #events/min_bin_width or
 #events/(min_bin_width unit), when the title in X contains the units in parenthesis
 Add option NOAUTOLABELS.

HistoStack:
- Simplify, only one internal histo to update the systematics when using several samples in needed in HistoStack
- set method of Y axis title

SystematicTools: 
- further simplification. All methods return an copy of the matrix and not a reference.
 Add a method TMatrixD GetSystematicCovBase(HistoStack* hs1, HistoStack* hs2, const std::string& uopt, const std::string& group);
 that is valid both for ratios and single tree/samples
- remove obsolete stuff
- Simplify, only one internal histo to update the systematics when using several samples in needed in HistoStack
- Get rid of the method use to get the cov matrix for a single tree. Instead use the same methods as for the Experiment
- remove condition ((avg[i]>1 && avg[j]>1) || uopt.find("RATIO")!=std::string::npos)
 to devide the cov matrix by the average, otherwise bins with N<1 (possible when there are weights and low number of events)
 will have 0 error.

WeightTools: 
- NOW and NOTOY weights should be independent.
 NOW switches off weight, weight_syst and weight_corr
 NOTOYW switches off toy_weight
- Added to the DrawingTools ability to apply the external weights with some options to include/exclude particular weights


highlandIO
------------------------------------------------------

highlandIO.parameters.dat:
- related to bug 1336, filter RooTrackerVtx also for FlatTree

CreateFlatTree:
- fill also the RooTrackerVtx for the last processed entry (the FlatTree was saved but not the RooTrackerVtx).
 In that way FlatTree and MiniTree will have the same behaviour
- related to bug 1336, filter RooTrackerVtx also for FlatTree

DataClassesIO:
- added storing CMTTriggerPattern vars stored as Double_t to have the precision for 32-bit

FlatTreeConverter:
- reading of AnaTrigger vars: FGD/TripT cosmic trigger moved here from psyche
- CTMTriggerPattern vars added

oaAnalysisP0DTreeConverter: 
- Filling the cycle information for cluster + adding hit information for 2D clusters directly from P0D Showers.

oaAnalysisTreeConverter:
- In DeleteTrueParticle one must consider now segments in all subdetectors since they all have a TrueObject member.
 This should solve https://bugzilla.nd280.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1430
- fill CTMTriggerPattern vars of AnaTrigger,
 split the orginial ones (3 total: SMRD top/left, SMRD bottom/right, p0d/dsecal)
 into two each,  so to have six 32-bit words (one per sub-module)
- Add cycle to cluster and a function def to add  hit information for 2D clusters directly from P0D Showers.


 
highlandUtils
------------------------------------------------------

app/BuildReWeightedMicroTree: 
- As requested in bug 1270 this is an application that adds weights to the microtrees provide an external file
 with weights. The new weights are stored into the vector of floats ext_weight, with size NEXTWEIGHTS. If you run the application
 over a file that already contains external weights, the new weight will be added to the vector
- include cstdlib needed for std::exit in jenkins server  

HighlandTreeConverterUtils: 
- when filling the proton information it is more consistent (between the
 generators as well) to use the most
 energeitc one,  not the first one ecountered

new src/EventDisplay folder
- added some general (well,  depends on BaseDataClasses,  but on very general
 stuff there) code for a simple EventDisplay,
 very basic things for the moment,  more to come: e.g. Helix propagator
 engine

oaAnalysisReader
-----------------------------------------------------

Prod7_RC1
- Adds missing files and removes a file that should be generated as part of the build.


highlandValidation
------------------------------------------------------

This is the version used for the validation of these release (nd280Highland2 v2r19)

- config.py: change nominal to v2r17
- flattree.parameters.dat: Swithch RooTracker filtering of to avoid mistmatching in NVtx between MiniTree/FlatTree and oaAnalysis


baseAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

baseAnalysis: 
- Use constructor of FluxWeighting with no arguments. The parameters are read in the constructor from psycheND280Utils.parameters.dat

baseAnalysis.parameters.dat
- both baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableFluxNeutrino and baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableFluxAntiNeutrino should be enabled. 
 One or the other will be used depending on the Run period

tutorialAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

tutorialBranchesSelection, tutorialSelection,
- GetSampleId() should return SampleId_h
- Use the proper method to be overloaded from the SelectionBase
 to retrieve the SampleId:
 SampleId_h GetSampleId() instead of SampleId::SampleEnum GetSampleEnum()


gammaAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

Update MinAccumLevel to adopt to changes in gamma selection in psyche.


p0dNumuCCQEAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

p0dNumuCCQESelection
- GetSampleId() should return SampleId_h
- Use the proper method to be overloaded from the SelectionBase
 to retrieve the SampleId:
 SampleId_h GetSampleId() instead of SampleId::SampleEnum GetSampleEnum()
- Implement mandatory FillEventSummary method for p0dNumuCCQESelection


p0dNumuCCAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

p0dNumuCCAnalysis:
- Fixed typo preventing systematics from being initialized


numuCCMultiTargetAnalysis
------------------------------------------------------

\section nd280Highland2_v2r21_history Version v2r21

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Sat Apr 22 20:51:32 2017
   - Freeze User: alexander
   - Freeze Host: alexandrs-mbp.home

An "intermediate" freeze with the goal to test the systematics tuning for NuMu analyses
+ some new featers being introduced for systematics/selections with the aim to make 4pi analyses available for BANFF (on-going)

CHANGES IN EACH PACKAGE:

nd280Psyche
------------------------------------------------------

-psycheCore
CoreUtils:

since not using c++11 features and so nor ROOT6 
introduced simple variadic functions to create a vector of ints/floats (known to
be not good)
templating it is not available with CINT
also added pre-processor macros to retrieve a number of params for variadic
functions

added template utilities:
KeepUniqueElementsInArray()
given an array and its size,  keeps only unique and non-NULL elements
resizes the array and returns the new size

this may be useful e.g. in filling various categories in various places, 
to be sure no to duplicate objects

CoreDataClasses.hxx 
increased const UInt_t NMAXRECOBJECTGROUPS = 50

SelectionBase.hxx
Important structural change: 
the retrieval of relevant true and reco object groups is removed from the
systematics and added to selections, 
this is a selection now that controls which objects to provide to each
systematic,  in this way we achieve:
- flexibility and optimisation: get rid of hard-coded groups in systematic which
  lead to a need to inherit from a systematic if one wants to use it for his own
  group; no need to use wider groups to cover several selections
- better user control on systematics, less things hidden in "black box"

added Initialize/FinalizeToy()
not obligatory but useful

EventVariationBase.cxx EventVariationBase.hxx 
EventWeightBase.cxx EventWeightBase.hxx 
Important structural change: 
the retrieval of relevant true and reco object groups is removed from the
systematics and added to selections,  
this is a selection now that controls which objects to provide to each
systematic,   in this way we achieve:

- flexibility and optimisation: get rid of hard-coded groups in systematic which
  lead to a need to inherit from a systematic if one wants to use it for his own
    group; no need to use wider groups to cover several selections
- better user control on systematics,  less things hidden in "black box"
    
The change was motivated by the integration of 4pi samples which need wider groups
    due to the usage of ToF
Each systematic calls the following methods from the selection
  Int_t* groups;
  anaUtils::CreateArray(groups,  NMAXRECOBJECTGROUPS);
  Int_t nGroups = sel.GetRelevantRecObjectGroupsForSystematic(_index, groups, 
ibranch);
  anaUtils::ResizeArray(groups, nGroups,  NMAXRECOBJECTGROUPS);
        

SelectionManager.cxx 
Solve bug 1449:
replace _objects TClonesArray by _eventSelections array in DumpSelections, since the
former is only available 
when using the DrawingTools (not in analysis code). 
Also increase the out array size such that the name of the selection can be larger



-psycheEventModel
SystId.hxx 
use single kFluxWeight
 
BaseDataClasses.cxx BaseDataClasses.hxx 
added a function to compare AnaTrackB muon momenta from range
added DSECal_FGD* 
ToF vars

For AnaTrueParticleB 
added variables needed for systematics fine-tuning for selections

GParentID (new)

>From AnaTrueParticle
Int_t PrimaryID
bool IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhoton;
bool IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhotonChild;


-psycheSystematics

FluxWeightSystematics.cxx FluxWeightSystematics.hxx 
FluxWeight is now 3D_SYMMETRIC_NOMEAN systematic
no need to use Neutrino and Antineutirno as separate systematics

combine data in one file FluxWeight.dat, 
for the moment first bin is dummy (0,  1e6) since nu and antinu files seem to be
the same

FluxWeight.dat 
combined nu and antinu systematics in one file, 
for the moment firt bin is dummy (0,  1e6) since nu and antinu data seem to be
the same

MomBiasFromVertexMigrationSystematics.cxx 
for the moment smear the momentum-by-range (muon) as well


Important structural change for systematics/selections: 
the retrieval of relevant true and reco object groups is removed from the
systematics and added to selections,  
this is a selection now that controls which objects to provide to each
systematic,   in this way we achieve:
- flexibility and optimisation: get rid of hard-coded groups in systematic which
  lead to a need to inherit from a systematic if one wants to use it for his own
    group; no need to use wider groups to cover several selections
- better user control on systematics,  less things hidden in "black box"
    
The change was motivated by the integration of 4pi samples which need wider groups
due to the usage of ToF.

Removed GetRelevantRec(True)ObjectGroups() methods, 
this is now the business of each selection

ToFResolSystematics.cxx ToFResolSystematics.hxx 
removed a parameter to control applying the ToF based flip in ToF
correction/systematic,  the latter will just do the smearing


SIProtonSystematics.cxx SIProtonSystematics.hxx 
simplify things:
use general   si_syst::ParticleSIManager _pInfoManager; manager

and set the proper propagator

// Set the proper propagator 
_pInfoManager.SetPropagator(new proton_si::ProtonSIPropagator());
   

properly set the initial status of _initialized to false! (causing crashes)

no need _initialized parameter
since Initialize method is called only ones when the systematics gets its id
index

        nueFGD2_TPC_PileUp.dat nueFGD2_upECal_PileUp.dat

Updated pile up numbers
Uses prod6M for data and prod6B for MC

run2water and run2air - Right BrECal tracks ignored in data, MC, sand for consistency
(because the sand as some dead channels in Right BrECal simulated)

Includes runs up to the end of run6

run6air code 13 and code 14 both estimated with run4air

P0DECal FV reintroduced as requested


-psycheSelections

Quite a few changes, some for future developments for 4pi analyses.

GetRelevantRec(True)ObjectGroupsForSystematic() methods
Systematics tuning revised and turned ON
for NuMu selections:
inclusive + mutli-pion  


Work still on-going for 4pi selections



NuE selections:
Properly FillSummaryAction for all the nue selections
Systematics tuning added
Adopted to the changes in SelectionBase
GetRelevantRec(True)ObjectGroupsForSystematic() methods
Use DsECal-FGD2 TOF vars (although the correction is not yet available)



-psycheUtils
BeamBunching.cxx 
Add a check to make sure that the bunch_time_data is not accessed out of bound
(valgrind error)

minor, remove compilation warning

-psycheIO

RedoTreeConverter.cxx RedoTreeConverter.hxx 
fill DSECal_FGD* ToF vars

Added GParentID variable

Added filling of PrimaryID, 
IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhoton, 
IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhotonChild, 
Entrance and Exit momenta for detectors
(all moved from FlatTreeConverter since are relevant for psyche)

Some cleanup:
FillTrueParticleInfo() is now a unique basic method 
that takes an additional array of AnaTrueVertexB* as input, 
in this way can avoid having basically similar methods 
for event and spill filling
  

-psycheND280Utils

PionInteractionSystematic.cxx PionInteractionSystematic.hxx 
Added a virtual method:
CheckLookForInteraction() to check whether a particular trajectory should be a
subject to a search for its interactions

This method can be overwritten hence makes the code available for general usage
for other FV,  e.g. TPC analysis

EventBoxTracker.hxx 
added new groups *WithStartOrEndInFGD*FV
needed for 4pi selections

EventBoxUtils.cxx 
fill new categories in EventBoxTracker
"WithStartOrEndInFGD*FV*

ProtonInteractionSystematic.hxx 
simplify things:
no need to use separate ProtonSIManager
will just set the proper propagator where needed

TruthUtils.cxx TruthUtils.hxx 
Check that a give true particle "leads" to the existence of a given reco object
In case of "Simple" only certain "generations" are considered:
direct, parent, grandparent and primary

In case of "Full" a looping takes place over parents (from the true particle
associated with the reco up to the primary) 

bool CheckTrueCausesRecoSimple(const AnaTrueParticleB& trueTrack,  const
AnaParticleB& track);


Also returns the generation is the association is found (0 --> direct
contributor)
bool CheckTrueCausesRecoFull(const AnaEventB& event,  const AnaTrueParticleB&
trueTrack,
const AnaParticleB& track,  int& gen);


CutUtils.cxx 
following the discussion at the NuMu meeting (April 18th,  2017)
do not use the upper limit for the AntiMuon TPC PID cut (previousely 0.7), 
added an explanation and the link to the corresponding material


-psycheSteering
psycheSteering.parameters.dat
Update the parameter file so that it works for run6 (valid run periods)
Turn on the proper selections
Make the nue selections work in nu and antinu mode

remove the wrong sign nues switch which actually don't exist

single param EnableFlux

AnalysisManager.cxx 
use single kFluxWeight 

highland2
------------------------------------------------------
-oaAnalysisReader
Added ECal vertexing info for prod7 candidate
highland2/oaAnalysisReader/src/prod7_RC1
oaAnalysisReaderLinkDef.h oaAnalysisReaderProjectHeaders.h0 
        oaAnalysisReaderProjectSource.cxx 
Added Files:
        ND__TTrackerECALReconModule__TECALReconVertexCandidate.h 
        ND__TTrackerECALReconModule__TECALReconVertexTrack.h 
Adds ECal-local vertexing headers to Prod7_RC1

-highlandCore

AnalysisAlgorithm.cxx AnalysisAlgorithm.hxx 
added the call to Initialize/FinalizeToy of the selection

-highlandEventModel


DataClasses.hxx
DataClasses.cxx
Added a new class AnaHit that stores basic info
added a possibility to have links for the corresponding true and reco objects
has utils for storing/reading from mini-tree

Add FgdHits array for AnaFgdTimeBin, 
it owns the hits,  added utils for storing/reading hits from mini-tree

Added CopyArrays(Vectors)IntoVectors(Arrays) for AnaSpill
to call the proper methods for AnaFgdTimeBins

Funcionality tested for mini-tree and it seems to work

Adds PIDMipHip_VACut data member to global ECal track segments.



Variables
Int_t PrimaryID;
bool IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhoton;
bool IsTruePrimaryPi0DecayPhotonChild;
moved to AnaTrueParticleB


DataClasses_LinkDef.h 
AnaHit class

Versioning.hxx 
/// P6 iteration with Vector to store the ID of the Trajectory that created the
//hit in FGD1
#define VERSION_HAS_FGD_HIT_TRUE_TRAJ_ID (!BEFORE_ANATOOLS_FILE(11, 31, 3))

/// P6 files have or to store information for single hits in FgdTimeBin
#define VERSION_HAS_FGD_HIT_INFO (!BEFORE_ANATOOLS_FILE(11, 17, 0))))

-highlandIO

 oaAnalysisTreeConverter.cxx oaAnalysisTreeConverter.hxx 

added filling FgdHits for AnaFgdTimeBins
controlled via param file

Adds global ECal vertex time fix which takes the average time of the global
vertex constituents as the vertex time because of a bug in the ECal vertexing
code in TGlobalVertex. Checks the vertex algorithm name before applying.

added DSECal_FGD* ToF vars
Adds filling of PIDMipHip_VACut for global ECal segments. (P7 only)

Adds public accessor for RooTrackerVertexEntry (input file index). Facilitates
adding this information to a micro tree for use with xsTool.


fill GParentID variable
of AnaTrueParticleB
 
 highlandIO.parameters.dat 
parameter to control whether to fill fgd hit info for AnaFgdTimeBin
off by default
highlandIO.oaAnalysis.FillFgdSingleHitsInfo 

do not fill FGD single hit info for FgdTimeBins for prod5

Adds global ECal vertex time fix which takes the average time of the global
vertex constituents as the vertex time because of a bug in the ECal vertexing
code in TGlobalVertex. Checks the vertex algorithm name before applying.

  DataClassesIO.cxx DataClassesIO.hxx 
added DSECal_FGD* ToF vars

added GParentID for AnaTrueParticleB

reflected the migration of some variables
from AnaTrueParticle to AnaTrueParticleB

  FlatTreeConverter.cxx FlatTreeConverter.hxx 
reflect changes in RedoTreeConverter in what concerns
filling of AnaTrueParticleB info

some cleanup


-highlandTools
A patch to adress a bug with drawing DataSamples
added

addressing bug 1461


-baseAnalysis
Several changes
        baseAnalysis.parameters.dat 
use single param
baseAnalysis.Weights.EnableFlux

        baseAnalysis.cxx 
use kFluxWeight controlled with single params, 
instead of kFluxWeightNeutrino and kFluxWeightAntiNeutrino

Initialize the neutrino parent position here 
so to be available for all highland business: including systematics
anaUtils::InitializeNeutrinoBeamLineParameters()

the initialization takes place in InitializeBase() method

and added 
p0dNumuCCQEAnalysis v2r11p3 so that all packages mentioned compile

Main highlights:
psycheSteering: correlated throws + validation
psycheSelection: fix gamma selection for FGD2

highland (anti)numu multi-pi:
many pion kinematic (both true and reco) need to NIWG checks

(hope final) summary is that what concerns machinery and systematics (minor updates
expected but in general everything is there including run-dependent ones):
psyche does not need any more changes, as far as BANFF (winter 2018 analysis) is
concerned 

The packages from psyche v3r27p1 (related to machinery, no changes in this version
 in what concerns TPC gas analysis)
and highland v2r23 were also tested for TREx (including the mini-trees) 
and the version will be used for TREx mini-trees production on grid

   - Freeze User: alexander
   - Freeze Host: alexandrs-macbook-pro.dyndns.cern.ch

A new freeze of nd280Highland2
the version has nd280Psyche v3r31p1 with a number of additions/modifications,
some were already in v3r29 patches but I`m lisitng some of them here:
- incorporate an ability to use local ROOT version via the psycheROOT CMT ROOT wrapper
- psychePolicy v3r3: added useful fragements here so not to depend on the EXTERN, so nd280Highland2 is really independent (unless using RECPACK) from the nd280 software
- psycheCore
ToyBoxB.cxx ToyBoxB.hxx 
addressing bug 1497, 
use the proper name ToyBoxB::kNoSuccessfulBranch (set to -1) instead of -1 

 EventWeightManager.cxx EventWeightManager.hxx 
added a control whether to apply weights only in case whether any of the
selection branches is "successful", ie all cuts passed 

true by default, so to mimic previous behavior

 HEPConstants.cxx HEPConstants.hxx 
removed the instance of TDatabasePDG instantiated on library creation stage, 
it may cause problems on some systems,  instead simply provide the instance
when called units::GetPDGBase()

- psycheSteering 

AnalysisManager:
fixed a typo when reading params for
psycheSteering.Selection.EnsureStrictExclusiveness
crucial one: 
fixed a typo in all the ProccessEvent() when applying the flux
the multiplication sign present can cause the flux weight to be applied twice,
so removed it

ps
ProccessEvent functions need some generalisation but will leave it for the next
iteration
cosmetics
RunSyst_New.cxx:
 - fixed a typo where nominal weights for flux and syst were switched places

- pscycheIO
RedoTreeConverter
enable reading ECal vars read so to have veto working in psyche

In other packages relfect changes in the base packages

Other details:
-psycheSelections

(anti-)nue and gamma selections:
Properly (=follow numu convention) SetDetectorFV. This will solve the issue with the
FGD2 gamma selection without the need to call nueSelection. SetDetectorFV has also
been set for nue and anti-nue selections.

Update the options for the main track selection for gammas. These are either HM
(default) or HMN or HMP.

Explicitly disable systematics not relevant for gamma selection.

antiNumuCCMultiPi
change the condition for the selection of fgd pions
<   if (!nmichelelectrons && nisofgdpions>0) pionFGD = 1;
---
>   if (!nmichelelectrons && nisofgdpions == 1) pionFGD = 1;

--         nueCCAnalysis.cxx nueCCAnalysis.hxx 

selelec_Q2recQE         -> uses the Q2_QE formula with E_QE.  Uses the recon mom and
cosT of the selected track.
selelec_true_Q2recQE         -> uses the Q2_QE formula with E_QE.  Uses the true mom
and
cosT of the selected track.
truelepton_Q2recQE          -> uses the Q2_QE formula with E_QE.  Uses the true mom and
cosT of the true lepton.

( we could also have Q2_true, which should be the actual true mom transfer with no
approx formula.  This could be added if desired.)


selelec_nuErecQE          -> uses the E_QE formula.  Uses the recon mom and cosT of
the selected track.
selelec_true_nuErecQE     -> uses the E_QE formula.  Uses the true mom and cosT of
the selected track.
truelepton_nuErecQE       -> uses the E_QE formula.  Uses the true mom and cosT of
the true lepton.

( nu_trueE still exists, which is the MC truth neutrino energy from the vertex)


Add the number of ecal hits for the ecal veto track, for debugging.


Add reaction/vertex based categories to the truth tree

   - Freeze Host: alexandrs-macbook-pro.local





A new freeze with two issues addressed wrt the previous one:


psycheND280Utils - affects proton SI systematics 

The code allowed particles` propagatation outside VOI which may results 
in wrong materials taken into account and/or endless small step propagations over 
low-density materials 


Added a protection so not to propagate particles outside VOI 

also added more protection over zero/negative momentum and improved the
debugging


highlandEventModel and highlandIO - affects P0D-iso analysis

A freeze to incorporate changes related to p0d-iso analysis
reflect the fact that 
for the moment make P0D bunch and event inherit from AnaLocalReconBunch/Event
  
  create pure AnaLocalReconBunch only when _isUsingReconDirP0DNew is OFF
  
  this allows one to read P0D "new" iso info from algo result together when
  other

 Replica tuned flux with bugfixes since 13av4  - 13av5
 
 The details can be found here:
 https://www.t2k.org/beam/NuFlux/FluxRelease/13areplica/13av5
 
 
 13av5 tuning is set as a default
 may of interested for NuE since has a reviewed K0 uncertainty which has a
 direct effect
 note! the tuning is applied up to run8 - no run9 for the moment since no MC for
 it
 
 Also added a parameter to control which file with the cov matrix to use when
 applying systematics:
 13av5 with BANFF bins is set as a default

Also added FGD-iso momentum calculated/corrected with a propagation to the
reconstructed vertex 
(proper HM pion/proton sorting was added as well for the AnaEventSummary output)

Other changes include a bug fix in ToFSenseCorrrector for FGD2-ECal topologies

Included psycheROOT as a base package, updated and tested by Jacek

Also updates to oaAnalysisReader (Jacek, during his tests on using a local ROOT version)





\section nd280Highland2_v2r39_history Version v2r39

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Wed Nov 13 23:30:28 2019
   - Freeze User: alexander
   - Freeze Host: alexandrs-mbp.home

A new freeze with two main goals:
- address an issue when oa modules are mis-synced with the rootracker 
info in the input oa files: the code now searches fully the rootracker tree
to find a match - if it fails - an error is reported


- introduce an infrustructure for new 
variables for BANFF: i.e. FGD-iso tracks with the vertex constraint - 
i.e. one can reconstruct bwd particles now

nd280Psyche v3r41

psyche/psycheEventModel version v3r31

Modified Files:
        BaseDataClasses.cxx BaseDataClasses.hxx 
Log Message:
addd Pion/ProtonDirection to AnaEventSummary since this var can be as well
corrected for FGD iso tracks due to vertex contraint



psyche/psycheND280Utils version v3r35

Modified Files:
        CutUtils.cxx CutUtils.hxx MultiParticleBox.cxx 
        MultiParticleBox.hxx PropagationUtils.cxx PropagationUtils.hxx 
Log Message:
A new update on the multi-pi selections to use the vertex constraint
Now in addition to mom-range momentum for FGD-iso tracks added filling of
direction variables as well,  so that bwd tracks can be reconstructed,
the mon-range is also now reconstructed using the direction (via vertex) constraint

psyche/psycheSelections version v3r39

Modified Files:
        antiNumuCCMultiPiFGD2Selection.cxx 
        antiNumuCCMultiPiSelection.cxx 
        numuBkgInAntiNuModeCCMultiPiFGD2Selection.cxx

        numuCCMultiPiFGD2Selection.cxx numuCCMultiPiSelection.cxx 
        numuCCMultiPiSelection.hxx 
Log Message:
A new update on the multi-pi selections to use the vertex constraint
Now in addition to mom-range momentum for FGD-iso tracks added filling of
direction variables as well,   so that bwd tracks can be reconstructed,
the mon-range is also now reconstructed using the direction (via vertex)
constraint

psyche/psycheIO version v3r23

Modified Files:
        MiniTreeConverter.cxx 
Log Message:
for POT added treatment for POTInfo and POTInfo_v2 cases



highland2/highlandIO version v2r31

A new freeze to add a funcionality to deal with mis-synchronisations
between the OA modules and rootracker 

Observed with the recent Prod6T - the problem causes problem with filling all the 
rootracker related info

Modified Files:
        oaAnalysisTreeConverter.cxx oaAnalysisTreeConverter.hxx 

updated the way mis-sybchronisation between oa and rootracker 
is treated: the rootracker will be checked in all the directions 
if needed 

Modified Files:
        FlatTreeConverter.cxx FlatTreeConverter.hxx 
treatment of possible mis-synchronisations between the flat-tree and
rootracker - the code will search the rootracker tree for a given event 
in case that 1-to-1 correspondence between OA and rootracker failed




highland2/numuCCMultiPiAnalysis version v2r17

A new freeze to include new variables, not a big update, but
no harm updating the release number

Modified Files:
        numuCCMultiPiAnalysis.cxx numuCCMultiPiAnalysis.hxx 
Log Message:
added vars for FGD-iso tracks directions (included) with the vertex constraint 
for pion and protons candidates
