Whether to enable the CT4/CT5 POT correction, and the DQ
corrections. These must be applied when creating the flat
tree, so that POT counting is correct. Applying the same
corrections in baseAnalysis when using FlatTree files as
input will have no effect. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT
YOU KEEP THESE CORRECTIONS ENABLED!

FLAT TREE READING

Use corrected values or raw values. The FlatTree contains corrected values for the TPC dxdx parameters.
We can used the corrected values from the FlatTree and not apply the corrections or use the corrected
values and apply the corrections when running the analysis. We can use the DrawingTools::DumpCorrections() method over the flattree file
to see what corrections were applied when creating the FlatTree

 < highlandIO.ReadFlatTree.UseCorrectedValues = 1 >
