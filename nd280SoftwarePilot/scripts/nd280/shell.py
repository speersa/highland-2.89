# This package is automatically available to python scripts in the
# pilot/scripts directory.
#
# Provide a compatible interface to shell commands.  This works around
# all the crazy deprecation going on in python.  This needs to support
# SL5 which only includes 2.4, and most of the 2.4 process handling is
# deprecated in 2.7 (which is standard on lots of systems).  This is
# suppose to survive the transition to python 3.0
