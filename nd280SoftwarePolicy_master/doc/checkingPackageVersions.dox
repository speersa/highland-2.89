/*! \page checkingPackageVersion Checking Package Version

The nd280SoftwarePolicy "version" fragment generates an include file for each
package that contains the package version, release, and patch number.  This
can then be used by any subsequent package to check that a particular
version is being used.  The "version" fragment also generates a couple of
utility macros to make it easier to check if you are using a particular
version or later.  The definitions are generated as follows

\code
#define $(package)_MAJOR_VERSION  <a number>
#define $(package)_MINOR_VERSION  <a number>
#define $(package)_PATCH_VERSION  <a number>
#define BEFORE_$(package)(v,r,p)  (<a complicated macro>)
#define EQUALS_$(package)(v,r,p)  (<a complicated macro>)
\endcode

As a specific example, this could be used in oaGeomInfo to check for a
particular version of oaEvent

\code
#if ! BEFORE_oaEvent(8,2,0)
    ClearGeometryCallback();
#endif
\endcode

This will only include the ClearGeometryCallback() call if using an oaEvent
version of 8.2.0 or later (this include 8.2.1).  In general, you should
check "! BEFORE_$(package)(version,release,patch)" against the package
version where the feature was added.
