Big changes since the last freeze: 

    - Many, many bug fixes 
    - Run by run flux weighting, for the 11b and 13a flux tuning
    - Addition of selection validity ranges, so we don't apply anti-neutrino 
      selections to neutrino data and MC.  Controlled by a comma separated 
      string in the psycheSteering parameter file
    - OSX/Darwin headers
    - Nominal bunch timing for run 5
    - Memory leak fixes
    - Information for pion SI systematic not computed if systematic is 
      disabled - events preload 30 times faster without pion SI

- MomentumResol, ChargeID, TPCFGDMatch, TPCPID
psycheSelections:
 - numuCCQE: Correct bug related with the usage of IgnoreRightECAL correction
 - nueCCSelection: Substantial change everywhere!! Almost fully validated 
 - fgd2CCSelection: add and use a NewExternalVetoCut in order to avoid events passing both FGD1 and FGD2 selections
psycheUtils:

   - Freeze Date: Tue Mar 31 19:42:26 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Major freeze with many changes 
to allow selection depending systematics, and performance optimization. 

This includes: 
 - New methods in Selections to tune the systematics
 - A new definition of boxes to make the code faster and allow selection dependent systematics
    ToyBoxB: Previously called AnaBox, with more variables. It is toy dependent
    EventBoxB: allows saving objects that are valid for all toys in the same event
    SystBoxB: To save the relevant tracks and true tracks for each systematic, depending on the selection
 - Preselection cuts t make the code faster
 - Option to not redo the selection, when variations do not change the relevant cuts behaviour.
 - A better way of treating selections in different detectors (FGD1, FGD2, etc)
 - Add all relevant selections for FGD2

All selections and systematics give the exact same results for FGD1 and FGD2 as in the patched version (v0r21p1 and v1r23p1) except:
 - MomentumResoluton and BField which are slightly different due to a bug now corrected
 - antiNumu gives different systematic results for FGD2. To be understood, but notice that this selection was not in psyche previously 


\section nd280Psyche_v2r3_history Version v2r3

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Thu Apr 30 17:36:33 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Correct many bugs, specially related with FlatTree-oaAnalysis and improve EventBox functionality

- temporary solution to make SIPion work with event preloading. Make Initialize and FinalizeEvent methods virtual
- correct important memory leak introduced in previous release. Must delete the arrays created within the steps
- proper treatment of indices for variation systematics. Worked for the default systematics but not for the ones added by the user
- deal with -250 KA current for antinu
- the task of creating the EventBox is given to each Selection. This does not mean that there will be an EventBox per selection, 
  but there could be several boxes. They are created and filled in the InitializeEvent method of the selection
  Add another level of abstraction in the EventBox. The base class EventBox contains only TracksInGroup and TrueTracksInGroup. 
  The user should inherit from it. The AnaEventB has now an array of EventBoxes, which are added by index
- make nomenclature constistent for antinu selection, now all the files are called MultiPi for antinu, 
- FGD2 selection modified to be exclusive with respect to the anti-nu selection in FGD1
- move numuCC backward selection to psyche
- Properly deal with the EventBox, which must be created now in the InitializeEvnet method of the selections
- Reuse more methods from other selections
- Set the preselection accum level to 2 for all selections. That means that only one toy will be run when the 
  quality_fiducial cut is not passed
- now that systematics and selections are validated we can start using IsRelevantSystematic to avoid 
 switching them off manualy in the parameters file
- OOFVFGD2_p5F.dat  was missing
- MomResol, BField, TPCClusterEff, TPCTrackEff, TPCFGDMatch and ChargeID where giving different results in oaAnalysis and FlatTrees because 
  they were using explicitely TPCSegments and FGDSegments with a particular index, assuming ordering is the same in FlatTrees and oaAnalysis. 
  Also we have to deal with the problem of several segments in the same detector

   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

Many changes, most of them related with new functionality:
 - MiniTree
 - Systematics tunning
 - Automatic geometry
 - PerSpill POT
 - etc

psychePolicy: 
- new package able to provide compiler rules generally for psyche/highland2,

psycheCore: infraestructure for new functionality

psycheUtils: main changes

- Automatic geomtry loading from input file. Switched off y default

psycheIO: 
  - Add New MiniTreeConverter, the same for highland2 and psyche

psycheSelections:
 - Use new systematic tunning functionality, specially the one that allows tunning in a per toy bases  
   (IsRelevant...TrackForSystematicInToy). Add syetamtic tunning for SIProton, SIPion, TPCTrackEff and Charge ID, 
   all of them switched off by default. 

psycheSystematics: All systematics OK againt patch except TPCTrackEff which needs some modifications and ChargeID, who gives slighly different results
- first version of momentum by range (muon) resolution systematics: is applied for FGD1(2)nonTPC objects
- first verion of Proton SI
- Import from the patch psycheSystematics v1r23p7 the new way for eff-like systematics (useNewWeights)

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Wed Jul  1 15:44:23 2015
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0.local

- Solve several problems related to the MiniTree (bug 1124) including memory leaks and linking between objects
- Make it work with event preloading
- Update OOFVSystematics and  TPCTrackEffSystematics to new methods used in the patched version. 
  Results are now identical
- Flux tuning: correctly handle Run 6 flux tunings. update to new files from http://www.t2k.org/beam/NuFlux/FluxRelease/13arelease/tunedflux13av1.1_june

GeometryManager, DetectorDefinition:
- TPC volumes for the moment are overall envelopes,  not only the drift ones,  this is to be "consistent" with the assumptions 
  made for the current OOFV studies,  although the overall concept should be reviewed (however the current TPC volumes differ slightly w.r.t. to the previous ones so 
  not to intersect with the rest of the detectors)
- new volume,  overall FGD/TPC tacker envelope, including there dead volumes
  may be useful for OOFV checks

   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0-2.local


SUMMARY:
- Many improvements in ECAL and P0D related systematics
- ToFSenseCorrector: moved here from hihglandUtils. Many improvements
- Variables for 4pi analysis added
- Modifications in numuCCMultiPiSelection
- New way of initializing selections. Still to be improved !!!!
- Functionality to load all parameters files following the package hierarchy, 
  such that the top level package is read first and its parameters are fixed

psychePolicy: 
- Improvements related with doxygen documentation treatment

psycheCore: 
- Selections: Add Initialize method which calls DefineSteps, DefineDetectorFV and Validate. 
  This method is called by the SelectionManager when adding a selection and also by the CopySteps methods of the selection. 
  In this way selections must not call anything in their constructor, which can be sometimes forgotten
- Add method to read all parameters file from a list of packages
  void LoadParametersFiles(const std::vector<std::string>& packageNames, bool fixed=false)
- new vars for AnaTrackB relevant for 4pi analysis: MomentumFlip, DirectioEnd and DirectionStartFlip

psycheSelections:
- numuCCMultiPiSelection: Add the Ecal pi0 veto + change the CCOther branch. 
  Remove the propagation of the track to avoid adding extra variables into psyche (only affects prod5)
- All selections: Implement the new DefineDetectorFV mandatory method
  don't call explicitelly the DefineSteps and DefineDetectorFV from the constructors. 
- temporarily initialize the selections being used in the constructor. This is because those selections are using the other selections but not to copy steps
 and therefore the selection being used is not initialised. WE NEED A BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS !!!

psycheSystematics: 
- GetRelevant...TrackGroups takes now a branch number as argument as well. Only for weight systematics. 
- For variation systematics In the GetRelevantTrackGroups loop over all branches to account for posible different FV
- use the "new" (well,  correct) way to get the systematics uncertainty, data-vs-mc difference is included into the systematics error as well
- get rid of shallow copying of SystematicSource which was not actually implemented and the code was a potential subject of bugs
- Many improvements in ECAL and P0D related systematics

psycheUtils:
- ToFSenseCorrector: moved here from hihglandUtils. Many improvements
- add new method std::vector<std::string> anaUtils::GetPackageHierarchy()
  which returns a vector of package names extracted from the PATH environment variable. 
  Related to bug 1226
- add GetNTargets (aka CalculateNumberOfTargets) and GetAreaFV and GetNucleonsPerNucleus, addressing bug 1188
  (temporarily in psyche, will go in highland after reorganization)

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Fri Feb  5 14:45:56 2016
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: portanselmo.ific.uv.es

Increase development version number to v3 before major reorganization

psycheSelections:
- numuCCFGD2Selection: to be consistent with FGD1 selection (in terms of how the systematics are applied)
  added IsRelevant...InToy() methods (they call FGD1` ones at the moment)

psycheSystematics: 
- Changes in TPCECalMatchEff.dat, TPCClusterEffSystematics, TPCFGDMatchEffSystematics, ECalTrackEffSystematics, ECalPIDSystematics, 
  TPCECalMatchEffSystematics, ECalPID.dat, TPCTrackEff_p6B.dat: 

psycheUtils:
- DetectorDefinition and FiducialVolumeDefinition: fix FGDs FV on layers border, as of bug 1244. Update default p0d fv to one in tn-73
- EventBoxUtils: corrected a stupid typo so to fix bug 1260  
- SecondaryInteractionSystematic: a new class to be the base one for various SI systematics:
  for the moment proton and kaon SI will inherit from it.

   - Freeze Date: Tue Mar  8 11:10:40 2016
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: Macintosh-64b9e8d35af0-2.local

Major reorganization 

- Two new packages: psycheEventModel and psycheND280Utils
  - psycheCore is split in psycheCore and psycheEventModel
  - psycheUtils is split in psycheUtils and psycheNd280Utils

- Changes in class names:
  - AnaTrackB --> AnaParticleB
  - AnaTrueTrackB --> AnaTrueParticleB
- remove tracker specific stuff from the ToyBoxB
- Add new level of inheritance AnaTrueObjectC and AnaRecObjectC such that 
 systematic tunning can work with objects other than tracks (particles), as 
 hits, vertices, clusters, etc.
- Very simple CoreDataClasses (with suffix C, ie. AnaEventC), needed by the machinery are introduced. 
 In this way the machinery can be independent of the event model. 
- Id enums and BaseDataClasses moved to a new package psycheEventModel
- Also substitute enums used for Ids (SystId, EventBoxId, SampleId, SubDetId) by a typedef (to an integer for the moment), 
 with similar name (SystId_h, EventBocId_h, where h stands for highland) such that they can be easily extended.
- The selection has now a member _eventBoxId that must be filled. Otherwise the selection validation fails
- started removing corrections from the variation-like systematics, make them of .._NMEAN types, 
 got rid of the usage of the mean value. MomentumResolSystematics pending
- RedoTreeConverter prepared to allow FlatTreeConverter inheritance

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Mon Apr 11 16:50:20 2016
   - Freeze User: acervera
   - Freeze Host: portanselmo.ific.uv.es

Freeze for BANFF development

Changes in psycheCore that affect implementation in most packages: 
- Add new Apply methods taking a ToyExperiment as input and not a ToyVariation. The idea is that the systematic deals internally with the appropriate parameters 
 from the ToyExperiment. The ToyExperiment is just a collection of parameters defining the experimental setup, organized in groups, a group for each systematic
- Weights and Variations have been generalised such that the can be used not only for systematics. Then the relevant classes have been renamed: 
 SystematicWeightBase    --> EventWeightBase
 SystematicVariationBase --> EventVariationBase
- The return type of the EventWeightBase::Apply is now Weight_h which is used as typedef in WeightType.
 WeightType currently has a Systematic (mean + variation) and a Correction (mean only)
- EventWeightBase: Apply --> ComputeWeight
- Add separate managers for EventWeights and EventVariations since those objects are more general than systematics.
- BinnedData --> BinnesParams to avoid confusion (data vs MC)

New selections and systematics
- Add nue, antinue and gamma selections and systematics. Also utility related methods

Some changes in the systematics: 
- TPCTrackEffSystematics: Added line to apply TPC track eff systematic to P0D selections. Will have no effect on FGD selections.
- TPCTrackEff_p6B.dat:  use 0.009 as lower error for data eff in TPC3, as suggested in https://bugzilla.nd280.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1258
- ToFResolSystematics: minor,  get rid of the possibility to apply a correction through the systemaic

MAINLY CORRECT BUGS IN MACHINERY. ALSO NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN SYSTEMATICS AND SELECTIONS

psycheIO
- change all static variables by data members (bug 1307)

psycheCore
- InputManager.cxx: clear the vector of converters after deleting them (bug 1306)
- correct potential bug in WeightType constructor: give the correction as first argument and the systematic as second argument

psycheEventModel: use dynamic_cast instead of static_cast in conversions from AnaParticleB to AnaTrackB since P0D objects are not AnaTracks. 
    This affects only MiniTree reading

psycheSelections: protonSI in numuCC and antiNumuCC
psycheUtils: 
- SystematicUtils: take as error the maximum between the lower and the upper error (bug 1257)
- Utilities to calculate the reconstructed neutrino direction and the transeverse kinematics moved from highlandUtils (bug 1247) 

psycheND280Utils:
- ND280AnalysisUtils: Update GetRunPeriod which now takes an optional subrun argument (bug 1282)
- nueCCUtils: Use Box utilities instead of GetAllTracks calls (bug 1224)

psycheSteering: remove obsolete CCQE stuff, which was removed from psycheSelections

psycheSystematics:
- TPCP0DMatchEffSystematics FGD-ECal/SMRD matching : use fine-tuning (IsRelevant...)
- TPCClusterEffSystematics, TPCFGDMatchEffSystematics: correct bug, correction should be given as first argument to Weight_h
- ChargeIDEffSystematics: correct bug 1278
- FluxWeightSystematics: Use ToyBoxND280, which is common for P0D and Tracker
- TPCTrackEffSystematics:  correct bug 1262#c3

- First version of the 4pi selection in psyche
- many improvenments in nue, antiNue and gamma selections
- renaming of numuBkg selections
- BunchPosition.dat:  New temporary Bunch timing to include the first Run 7 data. 

------------------------------------
psycheIO: in RedoTreeConverter main changes: 
- filled all the relevant vars of the AnaTrackB here: RangeMomentumMuon, MomentumFlip, NNodes, DirectionEnd
- got rid of the hack to deal with a possible Double_t input 
- the correct variable for Float_t FlatTrees is sSubRun and not sSubrun

psycheCore: Solve few bugs, and other changes not affecting general machinery. Main changes are 
- SelectionBase: don't do any thing related to event statistics  in MULTITHREAD mode. Proper initialization of event statistics
- CoreDataClasses:  make Clone and GetIsMC methods pure visrtual in AnaEventC. 
  GetIsMC was returning always true and the method was not virtual. This is why weights were applied to data files

psycheEventModel:
- BaseDataClasses: DirectionStartFlip var moved to highland2, implement GetEventInfoString
- SampleId: added samples for multi-pi selection for anti-nu CC  and  numu CC bkg  in anti-nu mode
           differentiate between antinumu/numuCCBkgInAntiNu multi-track and multi-pi samples

psycheSelections: 
- numuCC4piSelection: First version of the 4pi selection in psyche
- nue, antiNue and gamma: Update the systematics implementation. Add temporary functions to save some extra variables to further check the veto cuts. Some further fine tuning of the systematics.
- antiNumuCCSelection: IsRelevantSystematic() - fixed a typo so that systematics are actually applied
 IsRelevantTrueObjectForSystematicInToy() -- consider separately TpcTrackEff (since anti-muon is needed) and 
 ProtonSI (was already there),  for the rest use numuCCSelection
- all basic selections: box.TrueVertex must be assigned, otherwise the FluxSystematic does not work. 
- antiNumu, numuBkg: global re-naming: old 1/N-track selection are now named MiltiTrack, the proper MultiPi ones will be added later (dummy for the moment) 
- numuCCSelection: in  IsRelevantSystematic all of them are (that actually are) relevant: fine-tuning for pion/proton SI comes later
- re-naming: APPLY_MAINTRACK --> APPLY_SYST_FINE_TUNING (the action is in reality more general)
- nueCCSelection: FillTPCVetoTrackAction::Apply() the proper size of nTracks array is 3

psycheUtils: 
- AnalysisUtils: Add missing unistd.h include, required for call to getcwd() (on OS X 10.11.4)

- MomentumResolVariation: started adding an ability to do pure tpc based mom variation
   various new methods to smear TPC local momentum and then propagate to global
   propagate the smearing to the flip momentum as well!
- ContituentsUtils methods methods related ith the mass component and the Fgd module type take now "bool IsMC" as argument, and not event, since event is not avaiable 
   in FillTruthTree 

psycheSteering: 
- Added the 4pi Multipions selection
- antiNumuCC and numuCCBkg: old 1/N-track selection are now named MiltiTrack
 the proper MultiPi ones will be added later (dummy for the moment)))

psycheSystematics: main changes
- ECalEMEnergyScale.dat, TPCECalMatchEff.dat, ECalTrackEff.dat, TPCECalMatchEffSystematics.cxx: Update some of the ecal systematics based on the new numbers from TN-279
- MomentumResolSystematics: Use general MomentumResolVariation class
 able to switch between standard (ON) way of propagating the syst and
 the new TPC based. systematics is applied to the momentum flip as well. 
 Correction part is removed from the systematics (highlandCorrections takes care)

pyscheCore:
 - SelectionBase: for the fitters related methods: FillEventSummary() and GetSampleId(),
   make them "pure virtual" for the moment to force the selections aimed to be used by fitters to implement them
   Although should be careful with the design since:
   InitializeEvent(),  DefineDetectorFV(),
   FillEventSummary() and GetSampleId() do not seem to be mandatory
   to organize/develop a general selection (e.g. in highland)
- many more changes (look at the package freeze message)

psycheIO:
- RedoTreeConverter: move dealing with AnaTrigger vars (FGD/TtipT cosmics trigger)
  into highlandIO,  a proper cleanup to split psyche/highland2 vars is still
  pending

+ND280_USE(psycheSelections 3.51 )
Fixed issues with applying tracker systematics: TPC tracking efficiency and FGD hybrid efficiency to numu CC multi-pi photon/photon-proton FGD1/FGD2 selection. Missing of tuning which true tracks should be considered led to an overestimation of the systematics: i.e. all true TPC/FGD objects were considered w/o specifying an FGD detector of interest they should originate from.

+ND280_USE(psycheSystematics 3.51 )
Minor, added a protection against MC zero cross-sections, very rare edge case but can lead to non-valid correction/syst weights.

The main goal of the freeze is to add new versioning scheme for systematics, corrections and POT 

Now all possible productions included: Prod5, Prod6 and Prod7 wrt the previous is/isnt Prod6 check.

A Highland-run analysis by default will get and set a production index based on input, . if the version check is OFF then all defaults to Prod6. One can also set it with param file,
psycheSteering controls versioning with a param file.


For corrections and systematics split data storage files into Prod5, Prod6 and Prod7 where the appropriate data files should go. It also BinnedParams to use ExtensionSyst() or ExtenstionCorr() so that an appropriate data files is used for a correction or a systematic. 
As for these freeze Prod7 data for systematics and correction is just a copy of the one from Prod6: is expected to be populated with new numbers as Prod7 validation progresses. 

Also fixes a bug with versions checks in numuCCZeroPiAnalysis
