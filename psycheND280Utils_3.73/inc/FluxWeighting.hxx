/// This class provides functions to weight events according to a flux tuning.
/// A flux tuning file must be downloaded from t2k.org, and be accessible to
/// this code. The path to this file must be specified in the constructor of
/// this class. Analysers may wish to use the Parameters class, so that the
/// path to the weighting file may be specified in a parameters file, rather
/// than hard-coded.
///
/// Flux tuning files can be downloaded from:
///   http://www.t2k.org/beam/NuFlux/FluxRelease
///
/// baseAnalysis provides tools to simplify the application of the
/// FluxWeighting.
/// In your analysis class, you should specify the following three lines in your
/// class constructor:
///  _applyFluxWeight = <whether to enable the flux weighting>;
///  _fluxFile = <path to the file containing flux histograms>;
///  _fluxTuning = <name of the tuning to apply (say, tuned11b)>;
///
/// baseAnalysis will then save the appropriate weight based on the true
/// neutrino
/// flavour and energy in the ND::box().Vertex->TrueVertex member.
/// So, you should set the the ND::box().Vertex and ND::box().Vertex->TrueVertex
/// members in your analysis, based on the track you have selected. See
/// std_numucc_actions::FindVertex() for an example of how to set them. Note
/// that
/// std_numucc_actions::FindVertex() is called in
/// StandardCutsNumuCC::ApplyAllCuts().
