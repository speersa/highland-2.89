# -*- makefile -*-
# 
# A makefile fragment used by CMT to build an EXTERNAL library.

# This fragment is intended to run a user script which in turn will
# run a normal "configure;make;make install" on some external library
# (e.g. CLHEP or GEANT4).  

# The fragment will execute a shell script found in the ../src/
# directory.  The script should compile the library when it is run "sh
# <scriptname> compile <package> <tag>" where <package> is the current
# package root directory, and <tag> is the current architecture tag.
# When the script is run as "sh <scriptname> clean <package> <tag>",
# the imported source should be cleaned.  This is usually done with
# "make distclean"

# An example of use in the requirements file is 
#    "document external CLHEP compile_script"
