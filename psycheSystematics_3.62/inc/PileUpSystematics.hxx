/// There are a number of categories of possible pile up, but only the effect of sand muons is 	
/// significant for this analysis. Events are rejected if there is activity in TPC1 (cut *) since in most 
/// cases, the TPC1 activity is due to tracks from interactions downstream of the detector 
/// (sand muons) or outside the tracker fiducial volume. A quick study of MC events rejected due to 
/// the TPC1 veto indicates that the majority are not true CC interactions. Since sand muons are 
/// not included in the standard NEUT simulation, the Monte Carlo does not include the effect of 
/// events that are rejected due to coincidence with a Sand Muon and a correction must be made ...

// This systematic should then be applied as a simple weighting factor to all events in the analysis:

/// TN-152 for a longer explanaition
