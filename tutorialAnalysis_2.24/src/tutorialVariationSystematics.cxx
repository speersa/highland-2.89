/*
  A variation systematic is run before the selection, modifying the input data. The selection will then proceed 
  on that modified data, such that we can test the effect of any source variation on the final number of selected events and on 
  the distributions of any observable. As advanced, a variation systematic could have two effects:
  - Change the number of selected events because a variable we can on (or depends on it) is varied.
  - Change the value of an observable. 

  In this particular example we scale the momentum of all tracks, this will have a small effect on the number of selected events 
  (through the PID cut, which depends on momentum), because there is no direct cut on momentum, but a large effect on the distribution of 
  the muon candidate momentum

  /* A variation systematic inherits from two base classes:
     - EventVariationBase: The 1 in the constructor is the number of systematic parameters (one in this case).
     - BinnedParams: Allows dealing with the source parameters to be propagated (reads the .dat file, etc). In this particular case the 
       .dat file will be MomentumScale_ProdZ.dat under psycheSystematics/X.Y/data/ProdZ. The name of the systematic data file is the one given to the 
       BinnedParams constructor (above). The second argument in the constructor is the type of systematics source. Thse are the available types:

       For standard weight systematics: 
       k1D_SYMMETRIC:       the systematic depends on a single observable (i.e. momentum) and its error is symmetric
       k2D_SYMMETRIC:       the systematic depends on two observables (i.e. momentum and angle) and its error is symmetric
       k3D_SYMMETRIC:       the systematic depends on three observables and its error is symmetric
       k1D_SYMMETRIC_NOMEAN:   the systematic depends on a single observable (i.e. momentum) and its error is symmetric. The correction is not specified
       k2D_SYMMETRIC_NOMEAN:   the systematic depends on two observables (i.e. momentum and angle) and its error is symmetric. The correction is not specified
       k3D_SYMMETRIC_NOMEAN:   the systematic depends on three observables and its error is symmetric. The correction is not specified


       For efficiency-like weight systematics:
       k1D_EFF_SYMMETRIC:   the systematic depends on a single observable (i.e. momentum) and its error is symmetric
       k2D_EFF_SYMMETRIC,   the systematic depends on two observables (i.e. momentum and angle) and its error is symmetric
       k3D_EFF_SYMMETRIC,   the systematic depends on three observables and its error is symmetric
       k1D_EFF_ASSYMMETRIC: the systematic depends on a single observable (i.e. momentum) and its error is assymmetric
       k2D_EFF_ASSYMMETRIC: the systematic depends on two observables (i.e. momentum and angle) and its error is assymmetric
       k3D_EFF_ASSYMMETRIC, the systematic depends on three observables and its error is assymmetric

       Efficiency-like weight systematics need the values for data and MC control samples (with errors) and also the nominal for the MC analysis sample
      
       The third argument versionUtils::ExtensionSyst() will make sure to provide the proper ProdZ setting based on the input file (or params setting) 
       so to then locate the required .dat file
